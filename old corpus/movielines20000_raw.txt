Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve. No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds. That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too. Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD. Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day. I have some ice from the machine. Bring it in. Is he all right? He doesn't like it. I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice? Pour it in. On top of him? He's melting it as fast as we dump it in. Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy. How soon is soon enough? Couple of days. They'll examine you. If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him. Sun will be down in a minute. Gus, this -- Good coffee, isn't it? You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how! Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how! All right! I'm sorry? I don't get it. You did last night. Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down. All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers -- <u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States -- You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- -- it's not the source of the information that's important here -- -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this! -- Miss Kreutz, please -- -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off! So now you're asking for a student visa? What's happenin'? They're comin' with us. Pile in. Sure. Great...  ...Wanda! Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me. You warm my heart. Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay? Okay, Dad. You're fast. Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late. ...I don't want to die...! You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright? But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please... Justin. I won't let you die. Why not? I could give you a dozen good reasons. Shut up. Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you. Does Mom know you have company? It's just Linda. And Mark from school. Stand by with the battering-rams... We need another ten minutes... The bridge won't wait! Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much. The cops didn't try and strangle my ass. Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you. Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying? Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back. I said, you understand what I'm saying I understand woman, damn! Go sit over in that chair. Then it's malaria? It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk. Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! Caesar, someone could see us out here. You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move! Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still". You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission. What do I get? You get half mine and I get half yours. I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war. Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war? Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody. I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood. I need someone to translate for me. My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in. It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night. And I'm supposed to care? You could fake it. Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship. We don't have a relationship. I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking. I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child. Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it. I'd rather not. My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman? Now, Swana... First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman? Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman. Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard. That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade. You did that? Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that. Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi. Captain...? We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line. Well -- did he give you a lot of money? Who? The elderly man I told you about. Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman. He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all. Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees.

I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back. Good to know you, Karl. You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ... Don't be ridiculous! I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ... You're drunk! Okay - got light duty, three days. Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.

What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum... Yeah, Conundrum. ...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already. I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me. It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring. We took a nip of whiskey. To keep out the cold. Aye. ...isn't it perfect! ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. Computer device? Unlikely.

Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard! Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!

Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you. Chosen me? These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application. Not for lack of trying. Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me? I shall, gladly. Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning. No, I'm not afraid. Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes? Yes...?

Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him? So you think you can? No. I'm sorry. Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend? ....what....? I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy.

Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?! What? Out the window! Something just flew by! I didn't see anything. Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window.

We don't want you to go. Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do? Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with. Don't worry, four eyes. Oh my poor baby. Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad. I know. Primitive? I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People. What? Music. I can't believe what I'm seeing. I know, this is fucking nuts. ...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what? Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British.

I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know? Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning - From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper - -  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying - That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and - Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed - You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson. I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you. Who else you been to see? Well, I went down to Atlantic City - Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone. You know why?  She was so - Sure, sure. I'm going back there. Who else did you see? Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his - Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met - He made an awful lot of money. It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher! Bingo. You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father. Except he's lost, and I'm not. Lower me down. Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses? Next life.  Oh, what's that?

You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows. The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing. But why attack an Agent? He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it. You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do.

Get on with it then. Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call. You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet. This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got. And you were gonna pay me back? I am after this race. I'll take a ride. Go for it. Come on. He's not there. He's here.  Check the bathroom.

And I'd take it out on him. And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time. There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here. Renata tells me you're going to rent a car. I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant. How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk. Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident. I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you? I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine. I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her. You're not envious? Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office.

You don't have any fucking money.. No, I guess not. Drugged' is a stupid word. But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years. Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once. I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it. I heard what happened. Were the flags for Teddy? Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww. She's saying... a beautiful swan... Sleeeeew sheek baw... ... flying gracefully... over the rice fields. Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together. Stop, or I'll burst out crying. He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated. Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire. You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you. I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work. Then try again, You think so? I don't see why not. But what if---it wasn't real? Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever. Morning, friend, glorious day. As are they all. I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide. Homicide?  A detective? I'm starving. Will you please take it? What happened to Len Tashka? Couldn t make it. Splitting headache. The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren t around, they d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun. Pete... You okay? Yeah. Say it again. I'd do anything for you, Dil. And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>. Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe. Two weeks and three days. Um-hum! Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron? No, not at all! Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report. I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles. And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption. I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown. And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report. Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report? I am only insinuating that you are nervous. Nervous! Why should I be nervous? I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron! Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party? Will do. Mom! We're eating! What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are! I can't.  I have to know. Please -- I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him. How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung? I have done nothing against the ordnung. Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing? I have committed no sin. No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned! That is idle talk. Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child! You what? I want to be the way I was before. Good. I'll show you how, apey. Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh? Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend. What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis -- I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis. Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning. I'll be ready. Do you intend to stay here for some time? Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different. Well, they will be. Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner? There must be a phone around here somewhere. A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson. One more time. I get the imports. Ok! Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin. That's cause we're below sea level. ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself. That's not funny. Shelly, the Machine, Levene. You... That's great. Thank you, George. Why? Survival. ...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service? ...Naw. Made that up. Who do you work for? No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you? Trans Ocean Travel. Is that Ryuji? No. Ryuji just hires us. Hires you for what? To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details. How often they come here? He likes the quiet. They were here last week. And you, what do you like? That depends... -- he's a vampire. You're joking -- Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him. Dig. What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder. Get up. What? You're fired. I have new representation. Who? Go ahead. Really? Really. I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house? Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change. Is there a switch? Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth. I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan. Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show. Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry? I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it. I was just asking. No disrespect intended. Fine. Let's drop it. Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire. Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it. Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek. If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead. Yeah? You and what army? Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats. Well, if you must know, they could be closer. Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance. What was I saying? About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses... This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover. I knew you were lying. I'm sorry. Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing. No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open. Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar? Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China. Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done. No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto. You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night. Not lately.  Did you check messages? I thought you did. Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them. What's your problem? I've got no problems. Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back. Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home. You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning. I'm not a nai-ive little... Uh-huh. Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings? Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies. Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing. You're a very pretty girl, Paula. Are you all right? Oh yeah. You real down? I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian. Come on, let me drive. I'm fine. You rest. I feel like driving. Hello. Hi. No way. No thanks. I can't do it -- -- You can and you will, Mr. Carter. It's a very pleasant room, Ben. Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway. Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that? Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all. Who do you see? I see my sister. Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job. Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead. Well, maybe you better look again. Go away. Her name is Jill. What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who? Layton. Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for my daddy. He will be pleased when he comes home. I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand. Right, that checks out here. Are you married? Yes, sir. Any children? No, no children. All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions. Thank you very much. Next, please. We're really gonna be in a movie!? That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star. Piggyback ride. I don't mind. If you think he can hold me. Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me. Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow. Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man. Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers? You okay, Jesse? Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky. Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink. I guess so. I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn. Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them. No? How come? Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like. Good morning. You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong. Next time when I feel a little better perhaps. I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away. Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time. Well, I would appreciate that. There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay. Why?  Can he lay eggs? He's Canadian. Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you? He needn't disturb you. Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed. He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices. Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it? That's the way it's done. And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride? All I want's the money. Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all. Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back -- If you came back. If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth. Something like that. And everybody you care about would be dead and buried. No, Alex. It's, it's -- What? Unfeasible. Is that all? Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble. You killed him? Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood! You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop. It's Iggy Pop. Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway. Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him. The point is, you've got to find something new. You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy. The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and -- Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like... Passion... Boom!!! Boom!!! How do we bypass it? The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound. So what did you think? It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay? Yeah. Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude? Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now! Yeah... Here -- take this instead. I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks. Ssssh! What? I heard something. Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days... By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do. Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what? A serum test possibly. Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat. Thanks. Feel good? Yeah. You look all right. You want to pick it up a little? OK. The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning. Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her. I'm sure that's it. There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there? Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too. Of course. Yes? Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people. This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal. Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away. Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside. George, I don't -- You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside. No, I don't think so.  That's someone else. Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there? ...So what're you doing tonight? Going out with Meurice. It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell. I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it. We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol -- Give me a double. Take it easy now, Terry. Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey. Were you attracted to me right away? No. When did it start? Honestly? Uh-huh. When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me. Maybe you should see a psychiatrist. Why? That doesn't sound normal. I'm not normal. I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you. It is sacrilege! I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims. We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria. They don't give a shit about us! Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>... Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake... I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>! You buy this "blurry" business? Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please. What? Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me. Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan? On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners. We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us? Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think. Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she? But we don't need it, I'm sure. I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room. What about them? Am I as good as they? Hmmm - good coffee. You didn't answer my question. Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me. You still didn't answer my question. Well, if you don't know I can't tell you. Holy shit - Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in? Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me! Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me. You're lying -- Pull up my sleeve. Right arm. You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status. Very well, proceed, sir. First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me. I will do so as soon as possible. Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away. I have. Or there would be twice as many. But you're the fairest by far. You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why? Must they always follow us? I ordered it.  It's for your own safety. Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next. We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops. I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general. Swing up, son. What? Up you go.  Right now. He waited for you three hours! You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way -- I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie. Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible -- It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth-- Is he here, your friend.  The fireman? He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency. Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood? Don't worry. I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry. Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right. Initiate launch sequence. Activating injector assembly. <u>Who</u> are these guys...? Rich, comic book freaks. And why is it a vacant exercise? Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana. Who would that be. Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....? No, you're wrong about Verger. Oh, yes.  He's found Peace. Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken. And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet. I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that... Pass! You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a.. I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set.. Battery's dead.  Shit. Let's go! Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you. But now that you have it - I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you. Leave that alone! Wolfi! Put it down! What is this? Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you. Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished? What? What? The vaudeville, what'd you think? Yes. Can I see it? No. Why not? Because there's nothing to see. So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's? Three years.  Sister. Three years.  A rookie. A novice. Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows? Get dressed. We're leaving. You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it. Move it. And this has what to do with me? I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ... Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night. Well I'm woke now... you can take this off. Oh, Lydia! Lydia.  Lydia what? God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her. No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks... Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it. I'm here. OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock. He's here? He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit. Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming! Stop her! WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota. Yes, I am. About time! Not yet... Two days. And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about... Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills. So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?! It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about. They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for. But I'm afraid of-- Don't look down. I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your... I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room... In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman. I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go. This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it. You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you. Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave. No way... GET OUT!!! Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it... Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops? Shut up, Hank. This here's business. By God, I wish I knew. By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife! Why are you wearing that thing on your face? Germs, sir.  These places are full of them. I see.  One thing s for sure, he s ambitious. You ll be a busy man from now on. Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other. But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body. You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion! Lili... I love you! And I love you, my husband. He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael? To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires. And what's that? That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said. I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere. Up-tighteous and self-righteous. Did you call the Zoo? Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased. Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something? The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir. Good God. They suggested oranges. No! Don't Shoot! Don't worry. He won't. He's drunk. Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic. Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert.

Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life. Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself? Yes. Remember that shoe you lost... Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase. Got you a pack of Mores again, huh? Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech? Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em? I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it. Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process -- I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes. I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close. What do you mean, she was a hot number. If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do? They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn. What? Nothing.  Just...memories! Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking. Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers? Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh... Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari... Uhhh.. ahahaha... Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem? Uhhhmm... It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there... 212-555-4240. Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child. You're kidding! We were gonna grab some food. Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry. She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot. What? Grandma comes to visit me sometimes. Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair? Just the love in my heart. Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady. Check! You look different... More relaxed. What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown. This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly! Why, Craig. why? I... puppeteer. He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man. Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock. Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and... And what, Sergeant? I don't rightly know, sir. That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day. Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it? I -- This your car? Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today? Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well. Sorry to hear it. New Orleans, huh?... We was just there. Doesn't it worry you? No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me. We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend! Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing! Where do you want to do this? Probably the bathroom. Can't you do it out here? Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can - Stanzi! No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we? Leon, my little boy. Oh, Leon, you are so good. What do you think you're doing?! You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country. Share... Are you okay? Hurry up, for Christ's sake! Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom? This young woman. What brings you into my saloon? Luck, I guess. Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job. You didn't tell me you owned a saloon. He's coming around fine. Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car. BACK OFF, BURT...! Well, who put you two in charge? But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left. Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak! Ten percent. You guys got sack, I'll give you that much. Confidence. It's just confidence. Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...! Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect! She took care of the dealers... Hey, Mitch. ...pit bosses, floor managers. Thank you. But mostly... David? Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside. Right. Well, thanks. For the lift. No sweat. Only do me a favor? Sure. Stop calling me Vernon. ...once-in-a-lifetime. We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide. Sir, I think no such thing. Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold... Sir, Arnold is a traitor. I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect! I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part! I'm sorry? I don't get it. You did last night. Make a right.  You can't miss it. I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead. This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead? I never heard nothin' about it. You overslept? Goddamnit!-- What do you know about "the changes"? Well, I didn't know they was a secret club. Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes. That where he was shot? That's where he fell. You get much of that in here? It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out-- Deal drugs in the bathroom-- If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands. She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually. God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections. It's a great song. Thank you. And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother? Yes... Are you sure? Mother and Father said so... you know? I am stronger than you, Highlander. That's what the Kurgan said. The Kurgan was a pussy. Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel! Rogers Hornsby?!? He's all yours. I was holding him back. He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him. It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried. I should've put them out of the car and come sooner! When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know. --Bernstein, are you sure on this story? Absolutely-- --what about you?-- Nice to have a fire. Really. Turn 'er up a little. I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational. Thirty-seven. I just can't... Goodbye, Dante. Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma! Satan's in this little fella tonight! Sorry about this, Governor. But it won't take a minute. You were saying something in the other room, sir-- I'm a bitch. Yes, you are. And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you. Yes, he is. Why do you polish that thing all the time? You're talking to me? Why do you polish it? So -- how are things? Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine. Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone! If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat! What about me? Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in.... Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch. I don't know. Now think real hard, Doc.  Think. The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket? Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip. Hey... Enjoy your Kenworth. Bye, Dad. Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen? No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think. It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great. Really? Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death? Oh, it just came to me one day. Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know... Oh, gosh, you really think I can write? I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but... Right. ...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous. Oh! Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed. -- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you. That's not possible. I told you. There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself. Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry. No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry -- -- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport. Where? Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it. What do you mean? At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more. ...We goin'? Huh? No. It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself. What kind, Mom? Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed. You're not an easy person to get to know. Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets? How come you wanted to meet tonight? I wanted to get to know you better. Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office. Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running... As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here... World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission. Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness? That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world? He's going back. Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore. It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there. If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal. Even if we do, it might be too late. How did you know? It hit me like a ton of bricks. How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary. The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what? Let me go! Let me go! We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid. Ralph! Ralph! I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters. Harry S. Truman? My parents were great fans of the former President. Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two. Sure did. Dropped the big one on them. Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry? Right. Well, I'm fully covered. I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son. Yes. Where you from, Harry? California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions? Come on in. Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores. What else? Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am? What? This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand? Seth, if you were me -- Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes. Yes. Yes, Seth, I understand. Yes, Seth, I understand. Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones. Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger. Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron. Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying. I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends? What? Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev! I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear. It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us. Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind. Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort? I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty. You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet. How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone? Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket. The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain. Our... 'insignificance'? Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn. Me?  Why me? Don't you know?  How they're talking about you? I saw an article... I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster. What's wrong, Mother? Sshhh! He's in there. Can I get my life back? Maybe. I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened? We just have to make a new beginning. Cherry-red Tears. What? Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair. Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store. I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you. And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end... But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill? Yeah, I give a shit. See.  There.  What'd I tell you? ...and I'm going to get bounced and you're... ...let me...are you listening to me...? Yes. Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads. Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something... You know what those leads cost? The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets... Murray said... Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? You could? Do you care, Jimmy? Sure I do. You mean that? Yeah. I care, Dil. What do you want? I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude. Holy cow. We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door. Oh... Okay. As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her. Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not. That girl's an idiot. What?... Why? We copy. Stand by...  Tower? Tower, here. This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard. Copy, Air Force One. What is that you wear? My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless. Well... so much for common sense. You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears? No. What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then? No. What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year? Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk. Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here. What about this morning? Any developments? No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment. In this heat?  They're up now. So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen. Because I can't. What good does that do? By what you preach...none! Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you re not walking away! Oh, cut the crap! I just hate seeing you so stuck. He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure. You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn t one of them. Hello, Mrs. Worley. How do you do, Mr. Worley? Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley. Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today? Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley. Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley? New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None. Eight Days To Go I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me? Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>? We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM. Anything at the Airport? Press thought "no," whaddaya think...? <u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews... An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl. No rain. A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their... Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers. But who is left? I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis. Mom? Yes, Mikey? I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got? What? 550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade! Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you? I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" -- Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do. I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas. This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles. Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill? I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle. You're gonna kill him, ain't you? Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle. Pensacola. That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep. COME ON! I can't leave him! Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you? 1530 Rivington Street. -- What? Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex. You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice. We're immortal. You've always known that. Tell me why...you've got to tell me... It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well... They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow! You know her? Uh-uh.  Before my time. Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room? Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room. You killed them. It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so. So you killed them? The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends. And now you're gonna kill me, is that it? I didn't want it to turn out this way. Murphy, don't you see what's happening? I think I see it pretty well. It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way. I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that. It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out. I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple. I don't give a damn about the gold. I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice. It's for you. Frida. Tell her I'm eating. Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires... He was our teacher... He was great. Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster. I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it? Throw it out. That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window! Look, Nick. What's wrong? I'm impressed you can sew. Good. You sew very badly. You don't sew at all! A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes. That makes it harder still. Lawyers? Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins... Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked. Ronnie! Very good, Chief. They inspect cells. Leave to carry on, sir, please? Carry on, Chief. Sir. How so? Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine. Well... I can't think of anything. Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. What does that mean? I don't know. We'll find out. Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you. I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies? Nah. I don't play well with others. You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil. Get out of here. Goodbye. I better get the kids home. Not a perfect day. Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?! Just wait! You can't take her away from here! Why not? Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo. What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"? She came here in 1888! Why the beach? So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion. Bret... what the fuck...? Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it. Bret. What the hell is going on? We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident. Bret you are making no sense whatsoever. I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. Now? Light him. Is it possible to go in right after the explosion? Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they? Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut! I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way. My kid brother has one.  You know why? Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet. How'd you guess? That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have! No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged... Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it. Here you go, buddy. What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing. The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure. Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed. How? I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle. But they're somebody's children. Are you running a business or a charity ward? Well, all right . . . What did you tell her about the shop for? I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy. You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you? She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care? How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning? 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think? You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what? And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky? Not a problem unless you're gonna make -- <u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team. Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact. Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when -- I want it understood. Anything. No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone. Why? I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work. You wouldn't think a car would burn like that. Yessir. We should a brought wieners. Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us? No! What did you see? I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene? Then it'll have to wait until I finish. What? I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want. Gus? No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story. What if I say no? I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece. Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike. And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness. Dunbar. Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events. They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world. So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story -- Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin -- Buttfucks the cabin? And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending. So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber? That bugs you too? Little bit. Let's go talk to Bill... Yes. This is Mrs. Redi, Mary. I'll be out in a minute. That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say. I thought there was something funny about the whole thing. Funny? Something wrong. Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins. A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish! Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine! A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade! A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown! Evening. Welcome to Phoenix. Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight. Oh, everything's the same size, same price. By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch. Mike Reilly. I have a bad feeling about this. About the plane? What do you think it s gonna crash? Don t say that... I know we ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong. The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election. Before?!  Eisenhower approved that? He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt. Jesus! And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans. So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall? Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period. You used me, daddy! What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night! Is there something else I can do for you? Well, I'd love to see inside your club. You want to come inside? Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything. Noooooooooooooo! Where did you learn to shoot? So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week. Queen Harry? It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff. No Turks. We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only. They'd gone. Hi. Why? I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own... The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier. That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well. ...You don't? Nah, that's all forgotten. ...It is? Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back. Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he -- But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives! But, Buzz -- Say, that was a swell idea! But, Buzz, you know I never -- And Sid says you stole it! But Buzz -- It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again. Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you. You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight. Okay, Matt. Hey! Hey! Where are you going? ...there's got to be a way to access out back there... A king must marry, after all. ...of course... Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat -- Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard... Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it! What about me? You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ... How come ... ? Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ... Come on. Kip, talk to the guy So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential. Really? So I'm doing OK? And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind. She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up. How you feeling, Doc? Better. That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'. Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you? Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead. He's still sitting in that damn field. I think they call it a pasture. You're the doctor, what do you think? She seems very unhappy. Michael -- get off the phone. Why? Because I'm expecting a call. -- But it's Sunday. I know what day it is!  Get off the phone. I gotta go.  I'll call you later. -hold it, hold it- What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book? -- wait, just wait -- -- well, when does it get good? Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea. Nobody knows. Why? I don't know. You cut that up fer lunch, Luke. Yes, Boss. Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion? It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark. What could cause them?  What's in the Core? It's complicated... How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core? Honey, your nose! Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry. You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions. You mean about that gun? That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that. Okay, I'm on channel two. Stick to my heels. Was that Lincoln James I seen run off? He's fine. Just had a bad fall. Why's his britches round his knees? R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place. Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately. Captain... I'd like to go along... And no AC. Fan works. Now what? Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work. Sailor? Yeah? This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life. They're ready now. I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John. Ah, well... But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost. Have no fear.  It will come out well for me. I believe they will deport you. I have faced that problem before. But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me? Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go. But how, sir? The whole world thinks you're underground. I am underground. Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you? Please make way, please -- Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen. That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying. What is this? Hidden camera. Wings? We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts? I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus. I think it'd be better if you talk to me. Yeah? Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'. Glad to meet you, Winifred. Nice to meet you. Should we say a little prayer first? Just open the door. What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun. ...De profundis clamo ad te domine. What have you been doing? Wandering. That's OK. Look. We want you on the job. Oh, no. Come on, tell me. If I told you it might not come true. What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . . A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes. It's so... small. Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed. Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days? Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we? Veronica, you look like hell. Yeah, I just got back. Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance. I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good. Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want. Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night! Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are. Isn't there an easier way? Not if you're going to stay true to yourself. Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset. We're not canceling. I know. I won't even discuss it. No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back. I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow. Don't we already have someone to do that for us? Yeah. You. Okay. Okay. Why were you so careless? I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally? Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me. I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in... Lunch... God... Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind? Don't be silly. You're really a love -- you sure? -- No. No really. Well, what is it, honey? Nothing. It must be something. Well, it's George. I thought you said things were great with George. Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you? We don't think marriage is important. But you have problems? -- Yeah, honey... I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy. Sorry.  I don't know anything about it. Come on, gimme a break. I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth. You don't need to be here. What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you? You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him! Yes I can...  INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right? Coulda been much worse. That's what I'm thinkin'... There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say. Good. The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run. But you knew that, right? It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus. Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you. Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean? You can't just... kill him. I'm not.  Just a little poach job. Jesus. Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass. But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand... I'm not that desperate. I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing. I've got a meeting in Chinatown. Let's get a cab. -- Roger -- ? Denver is where he should be. I'll give it everything. You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak. Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission... I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone? You have to dial nine first. Where you going? Helen Hudson... What the hell you need her for? Because I think I'm wrong. You never really trusted me. You live a fabulous life, Robin. Despite you. I never asked for more. That's the problem. Please don't leave me. I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do. Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan-- I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap. Mr. Jameson-- I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for-- Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in-- I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage! You print pictures of Bigfoot! Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures? Mr. Jameson-- No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures? Can I get a word in edgewise? No!  Now get outta my face, kid. If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them. Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right? What? We need to get past them. What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? I hate this. Turn that off. Made your million, yet? Not yet. How's TransOcean doing? Access granted.  Male or female? Male. Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De -- -- Waiter. Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name? Brad. Brad is not a good name for a cocktail. Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school? Brad? No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash. Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail! I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan. Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show. Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry? I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it. I was just asking. No disrespect intended. Fine. Let's drop it. Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire. Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it. Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek. What are you doing? My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on. Let me see it.  Did you drop it? No. You're late. My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go. Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth. What are you talking about? Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison. A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?! Cool, huh huh huh. That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys. Release the power WITH the power. What does that mean?! I'll do it, Jake. No way.... It's my fault...I have to.... We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me.... Jake. I'm the one who wanted to study it.... Oh my God, he's back. In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices. Shut up. Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept? What's its current position? Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox. Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. Can I... um... have some water?  Please? Sure. What do you mean by 'dirty looks'? Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face. When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this? That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him. Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen... And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room... As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square. What's happening at the waterfront? We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so. Excellent. You make movies, huh? I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen. But -- I was just lucky. Well? Don't a politician have to be? I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me. You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched. It's almost like flying. What about the trees? The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground. Get him to stand up, Night Shift. All right. Okay!  All right!  What happened, Cookie? Who did it? We did it. There better not be anything missing. This is private property. Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones. What the hell you talking about? This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked. You hear me?  Ben? Ease off.  We do this my way. Dad!  I know! Do you know about the clitoris? Yes dad. Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate. Thank you, dad, I got it. Okay, well that about covers it. If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry. You're a loser. Hey ... you'll be able to do it now. What ... ? Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ... *Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change? The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away! That's what I said--the *truth*! Don't cry. It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake. You weren't a paper champion. Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy. Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!! Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know? You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge. Aye, sir. Help! Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me. Detective, does it look like a murder? We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done. How many victims are up there? There are two bodies found at this point. Can we go up to the crime scene? You know you can't do that.  C'mon. Is it drug related? We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know. Hey, listen, listen. What? Gimme a kiss. Really? Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right? Yeah. And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay? Oh, all right. And we'll digest our food better. Okay. Okay? Yeah. Maybe.  I should call Ben. Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I. Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m. What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables? I can't help it  it sticks in my mind. What's Harry doing with your suit in there? Fixing it. Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that? The refridgerator. The refridgerator. It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any. That wasn't in there before. We must've had it delivered then. Wait a second -- 1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good. None of this was here before. Did you look?  It was on the top shelf. No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it. You think? You don't believe me. All I know is I opened that refridgerator -- Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up. This being after you so carefully fixed my suit. You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't? I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there. Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me? You working on someone right now? I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great. She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception? Look, someone gave her the baby. Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial. Why do you think that? Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient. Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here. Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally... The science of psychiatry. Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination. I am not with the Inquisition. And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open. She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested. Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate. Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed. It won't be easy, Sire. Try ruling the world sometime. It is now. You can't just take it! You want these people. These people, my people, I want my people. You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank. I had to. It was the only way I could get at them. What do you want from us? Just listen. We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive. I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg. You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor. I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- Which was? Passion. They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room. I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now. James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West! Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this. I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop. That needle ain't pointing north! It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down. Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes. It's all I have. Yeah, I guess so. What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet. I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager? Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD? I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here. Why don't you just call him? I dunno. Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry. Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number. ...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh... Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>... Tell him why we moved here. Hold it, Jim. You can't protect me. You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car-- You buy me many things.  Thank you. Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we? I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work. You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job. What did you get? I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany. Good. You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...? If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand... You slept with her! How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us? You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money? Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax. I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy. What's the decoy? Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief? Shoot! Put your napkins in your laps and eat up. How come you're not eating? I know. So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired. So what are you thinkin' here? Really want to know? But the damage report -- we were immobilized... Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus... I don't need you.  Andy's here. You always go with Andy. How was dive class? Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye. Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot. Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about. What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm? Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice. Good move. Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers. He's still looking, Col. Persistent. Good thing in a man. An excellent quality. Maybe he wants something. I would expect he does. Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check. Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap? No, man. I'm gonna bail. Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us. What? Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years? Now wait a minute, wait a minute... I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson. Why, Cyril, you're insane  No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer  Cyril! They're distracting us? From what? What the fuck?  Is he going to walk? He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals. Don't you <u>dare</u>. I saw some ghosts. What do you think? I think they're made for each other. And it scares me. No thank you sir we're fine. So Mark, what's so urgent? Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them Alright, put this on. What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on. Don't argue, goddamnit, just-- No way!  Forget it.  Not an option. You know what we're going to do after dinner? The dishes? I mean, after that? What? You don't have to if you don't want to -- I don't? We're going to finish that gin game. Oh. So I want you to keep a clear head. Bandit two, you read me? You're soundin' real bodacious. Back. Things have been so serious here lately. Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real. Crash Davis? The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear. You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off? No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime - Is that Doctor still up there, Brother. Yeah, he's still up there. What's taking the rascal so long? You're a lucky man. Yeah, sure. What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean. It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you. We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out. Always a mood killer. Still sweet. Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks. I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector. I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you. Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after? Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will. What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too. I wonder how she's gonna fix that one. Sir, please lower your voice-- Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in? That is our most modestly priced receptacle. You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece? What, sweetheart? I want to see Pilgrim. For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart? All right, motherfucker, that's it. Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner. Just until he heals up? Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it! Go away, Nosey. Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you! Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one. Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone. No, we are not. Theo... Did you? Maybe you did it yourself. Why? I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it... Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo. Excuse me, Agent Mackelway? This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero. Here. Don't even thank me. I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars. I simply don't have it, Joe. Get outta my way. You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there. What do you want to know? Your name. And -- Judy Barton. Who you are -- Just a girl, I work at Magnin's -- -- and how you happen to be living here. It's a place to live, that's all. But you haven't lived here long. About three years. No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!? I told you! Right here! But before! Where did you live before!?! Salina, Kansas! What a dork. Huh huh. Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh. Thanks. It must've happened right after we left. Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit. Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh? The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.  And where are you going? After that re-... So what's the, uh, problem this time? This time I really think I have something. Forget her. She still loves me. She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this. She's my destiny. Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride. You'll see. How are you doing? Okay. We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go. I don't feel anything. Oh, Jesus. Why do you want to know my name? Because I want to know who I'm looking at. Take care. Take care?  Where the hell are you going -- Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis. Remember Braddock? That bad? Worse. Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary. Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons. They were all veterans. Okay. Just take it easy. Right away. Okay? I-I'll do it. Okay. You have no idea what precipitated his behavior? ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there... The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral... That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns... What kind of concerns? We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out. Anything wrong? No. I don't think so. Well? Supper at my place? OK. But late. Great! Go back to your files. Bye. Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother... Shut up! You a cop or something? Or somethin'. Sonofagun! Look at this here! First paycheck? First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax! That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65. I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool. Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name? Annoying Customer. What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we? You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax. My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing. You couldn't have made that jump. I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy. How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us. He could have died. But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that. He's harmless. Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk. He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun. C'mon Tim, move down, damn it! Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick! Where are you? I'm here. She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease. Can he save her? No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research- Keeping the Fix happy. You never know when you can use a crooked cop. Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby. So you want to know how to play the Big Con. In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con. That was good. Can we talk about something? Not now. I have an idea. This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me? Certainly. Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind. I won't. Thank you. How do you know him? We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place. Wait! He works for YOU? Now. But first, he worked for you. You were going to have this thug...? Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence. You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time. Really? Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtw ngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtw ngler. But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday. He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand. Whoa!  What the hell was that?! Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses! Oh! Something bit me, too! Now come on - you're acting silly -- What's the problem? I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?! And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures. I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me... Excuse me, sir? I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me. Where've you been riding, Lance? I haven't surfed since I got here. That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too. You sure you don't want a lift back home? No thanks.  It's not that far. How could you not *care* about the movie? You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie. That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie. Not with the right girl you wouldn't. Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you... But you can't. At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted? Shit!! It's my subway defense system. What-- You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad. Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold. -- I've got to study. All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory. What about The Untouchables? I don't rate that at all. Despite the Academy award? That means fuck all. The sympathy vote. Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it? Yeah. That's your theory? Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated. Give me the gun. Goodbye, Paul. Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division. You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser. No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser. My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you. This could be it. I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it. Jim, are you all right? No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want. Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works. Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon. This way. Are you all right?  Are you still you? I'm not sure dear?  What do you think? Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before. Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip. ...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh... Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>... You were saying? Getting eaten!? That was your plan!? Where are you going ? A funeral. That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ? Yeah. How do you feel about him now ? I don't know, Zander. I do. She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells. Oh, so I'm disposable? Mr. Millaney? Yeah. Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office. Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client. He said immediately. All right, jesus. Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English. We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked. I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that. Really? I never got a message. That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times. What for? If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened. At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring. Calvin! Coming! Colette, go. I don't want to leave you. Your daughter needs you.  Go. Please, I don't use guns. There is nothing to it. Well... well, now. Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot. Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up. Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame. Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody. Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to. GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here. ...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning. Just forget about it. Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then... Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there... Yeah, but I want Carmen. You got it bad. What was-? Why...? That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner. ...Who? Marty. I have to talk to you. We are talking... No, in person.  Now. It's twelve-thirty! I'm coming over. I see it. Pull it. Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it. Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you? Come over tomorrow and read it to me? Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with? Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself! Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four... This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman? A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did. Umm, where do you want this? Oh, just put it over there. Any word? Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town. Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh... She admires.  Tommy Lasorda. Waiter! Check, please! She finds him "personable. Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically? What'll I do with this card? You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying? Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me. My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone. We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper! I'm the Princess, aren't I? Of course -- And do Princesses do improper things? Of course not -- Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises. Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me. I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God. But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne? But it is what I want. To be killed in battle? If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever. Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake... He'll learn. We ain't taking him to a hospital. If we don't, he'll die. And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't. That fuckin did it! Look at Him go. Bam! Bam! Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way. This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes! You mean a Tesla coil? If you say so. Franks and beans! Jesus, I think her brother spotted me. Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late. Call chauffeur.  Get car. Good.  Good.  We go Motel. No.  We go. Oh my God! Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!! Oh, god, it's you -- You're okay. Thank god. Is he? They do it to honor the dead, Ellen. Is that right, dad? See ya. Later. Yes laddie, I have her. Should I care? Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you? Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time. Do we even get our same bunks back? Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours. You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag? Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool. Like I always do? Thass right. Just play it... Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today? Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled. Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it. Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again! Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose. Oh, no, sir. Wake up. Is he dead? Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter? Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking. Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up. He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job. A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise. What do you know about trilogies? You mean like, movie trilogies? You seem to like movies, Detective. Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney. I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective. All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off. Did you request this case? No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios. Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people. To me Hollywood is about death. Excuse me? I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that. What do you mean? I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone. Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts. Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott. Hmm. What did you know about your mother? I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it. Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news. How is that good news? Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that. Oh yeah, how? Catch him, or kill him. Right. Then it's a deal. Burned out.  I need a vacation. Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya? When will I hear from you? As soon as is humanly possible. Yeah, still got one poking around. That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt. Roger that. Captain Miller, I just want to say... The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks. You're not taking me seriously. Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously. It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me. Huh? Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan. I-- uh-- Uh is a good start. I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise-- Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you. A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got. Yes, monsieur. Right away... instantly! Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly... For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then... Sir.  I thought those records were sealed. We're the government, Cowan. Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name. I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore -- Uh-huh. Does this sound weird? Well I'm not sure why you're calling me. There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer. What kind of Cancer? Brain and Lung. My mother had breast cancer. It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it? Oh, she's fine. Oh that's good. It was scary though. It's a helluva disease. Sure is.  So why call me? What the fuck -- ? Paraffin. What? Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. I wonder if we ought to-- Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight. You think it's all right for you to stay here? I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight. Why did you come to ... my province. We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help. You were not coming here, to see me? No -- no, sir. You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you? What do you mean, Colonel? What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things? You know you're right. She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy-- That's enough, Ellen. I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now. Better than starving to death. Hello. What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink? Yes. Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe. Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me? Later. I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man. Cease fire with the bullshit. Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right. I don't want him. Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy. Would you like to come along? We can't. It's better than going to prison for heresy. Martie...don't go! Not this time. You crazy? It's too late...She's a woman grown now... I got to fetch her home... Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?... <U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth! Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to! Only if I'm dead! She's down.  Help her... Take me to her. I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now. Not for me. I don't touch it no more. God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'. I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha? Here we are. Something's wrong here.  It feels like... Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl! Don't worry. She's good with kids. It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone? Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La? I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out! I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone. The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years! Father Perrault is dead. He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you! Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you? Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he? Yes. I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman? Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics? No.  I thought you had them. All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you. You know how to use one a these? I've seen 'em used on TV. Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad! Scandalous! What would your dear mother say? One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three... I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that? Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come! Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right. Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important. After the kids are back in school. Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents. Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here? What's this all about? I'm out of ammo! I'm out of fuel! I cannot get rid of you. No, you can't. Travers!  Hurry it up. On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready. It's really on there tight. Here, let me try. I can't take this. Ben.  This is business.  Just work. Spike. I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it? Maybe. And she's in your house. Yes. And you get on very well. Yes. Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one? Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip. Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go? Spike! No -- you're right. I'll talk to you in the morning. Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay. Can you afford this place? Yeah. Oh yes, you are one of my favorites. What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do? You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks. Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other -- What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal -- Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission. Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories! I have seen ghosts, Whitman. Oh, I'll bet you have. So what are you thinking? We're out of a job. This is either crazy, or brilliant. Remarkable how often those two traits coincide. Aren't you dead? Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill? You don't kill anyone. You've got a mustache. A bit of one. I was looking forward to this evening. I had a hotel room. I thought that was for when we were very very old? I'm feeling old. So that stuff -- it kills people. Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff. Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley? Have you been to the water board? Hunh-uh.  What's that? Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there. County water board.  All righty, thanks. Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ... She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from -- Danny, go downstairs -- Now! Hang on! Dad!  Dad! I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay.... What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh? Get outta here. I thought you were over it. I am. Well, maybe not completely-- Never did catch your name. Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton. Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar? What are you doing here? Fixing a leak under your sink. Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here? We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead. Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive? Yes... But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we? I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century. Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place? Are you okay? Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down? I'll order Riker to turn around. Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen? Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top. They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph... Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go. He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape. This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk. If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again? Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous. The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in. Hum. What? Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah... Shit. You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered. Get that outta my face. The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea. Tea is fine. I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested, Go on foot. It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot. What the hell can I do? What you've already decided. You're not really asking. If I were? Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh? I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence. Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword. Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out? You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape. Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray". What? You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!

You sure we can open anything? Anything we want? He doesn't gamble. I'll watch. It s been interesting, that s for sure. But I ve done some good things too, haven t I? You ve been Jack Campbell.  And that s always a good thing... You make me weak. Not as weak as I. How long you had this? Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet. I'm sure. He's a very private person, actually. Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he? ...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!

You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins. Nurse! Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance. Nurse! The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me. Nurse! Oh God! Alex! It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others. Where are we going? Let's go hassle Josh. Hassle"? I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water. What's the difference? Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession. Would you like me to help you pass them back? I don't need your help. Have you counted the money? Yeah, it's all there, to the pound. They were going to pay, then? It looks like  t, but who knows? The opportunity was there.

Ethics are... I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell. Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies. She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then... I know.  The feeling just vanished. I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy. Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person. I'm totally over her.  Positively. Me too.  Great stems, though. Umm-hmmmm. Definitely. Is that an offer? It is not. Okay, is the vault open? I can take care of that. AAAAAAAAAAAA ! Cover us, Ace ! Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't... The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City... Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but.. You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel. Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina. Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay? Fine. You got some mouth! Johnny, you're a real jerk-off. Is it dry? Yeah seems okay. Doc!... It's not me, is it? What? Yes, Caesar? Jerses -- tomorrow... What're we having? My special, scrambled eggs surprise. Scrambled eggs surprise? We still on schedule? Forty-two minutes ahead. Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one? I'm all right. You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn. How's the left these days? What's it to you? I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style. What do you want, Mr. Policeman? You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there. Till 19-fucking-70. How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A. ...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus. No again? I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines. Really? I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune. He agreed? He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage. Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up! Yeah, Mac? Bye-bye. They're already dead. Get on board. You're fuckin' with me. I know you are. Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that. No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and.... I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out. The police always do, don't they? You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example. Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration -- I'm sure I can come up with something. Thank you. You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome. Please... be cool. May be please have the wallet. <u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it? You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts? Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on. Nothing's real. Excuse me? <u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and-- I am one lucky guy. Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out. But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now. Are you warm, Captain? The river is beautiful. An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face. Painted"? There can't be any wrong in this, Ha... I lie to my parents every day. And every night. But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in. I didn't say that I would run... I just... Are you a 5 or a 6? Six. I go red next year. You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try? You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item. And, instead, he printed his heel in your face? I see you're full of human feelings... Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months? Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill? Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman. I mean, for good, Jeffrey. For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term. Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store. Mom. She had a moustache. She was European! All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman -- How long have you been here? Maybe ten minutes...  That s strange. Spinning backwards? Zander, what are you doing ? Just giving you something to remember me by, baby. Zander, no...! It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives. A factor of age. I hope I never get that old. You won't. 1600 m.p.h.  and increasing! Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION! What the - We've fired on the Chancellor's ship - Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did. Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission? I'm a patriate. Don't even think that I'm buying that. Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us. I didn't say I was. Bloody fucking hell... That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies. Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies. I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know? I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress... ...acts. I'll relay your message. Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello. Charlie... You never wanna try anything new, Alvy. How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome. That's sick! Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick. ...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey? She's dead, Barton! If that was her name. Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless. Alchemy. What is that?  A handkerchief? It's nothing ... nothing. I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on. You can't just stroll down the road, you know. We got a problem here, brother? Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out. Lugosi? Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>! Isn't he dead? No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture. OUR picture? Uh, yeah.  Our picture. There is nothing. Reach out farther. Call to her. Lyssa ... Lyssa ... No it isn't .. It's Californian .. Even better. One of 'em must have escaped. That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up. Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry. What do you mean, a part of Harry? When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere. You think, in the sphere -- He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things. But how? I don't know. How can the sphere do that? I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... Which I told Barnes was attacking -- It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real. But why is he doing it? He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream. His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you? No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are. What is all this shit? We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek. Why? See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful-- This isn't working out for me anymore. Yeah, me neither. Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and... John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you. What happened? Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else. Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do! I have a pretty good idea. You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door? I overheard him with the girl. <u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him? I don't know. Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked! Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall. Yeah! What is it? I know you? Name's Otis. Otis what? Payne. One of Cleroe Payne's boys? Uh-huh. I sent your Daddy to the farm once. I know that. Why you think that was? You look a little shaken. I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now... Last night? What do you mean? A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening? I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's? No, I have my things in the car. Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better. If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia. I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization. I'm not apologizing for shit! Say you're sorry. Fuck that. Wait! He works for YOU? Now. But first, he worked for you. You were going to have this thug...? Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence. You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you. Move it. We got exactly five minutes left. It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone? Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine. You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me. Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! Just get outta my bed. And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam. You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris. I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either. Confutatis Maledictis. We ended in F Major? Yes. So now - A minor. Suddenly. And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast. Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape. You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault. Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out. My fight's not with you, Holliday. I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember? I was kidding about that. What happened?--Was Meurice there? Yeah. You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals. I get my own help. You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up. On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling. He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments. I bet you could do a book. No. I couldn't. Why do you say that? Because I already tried once. Want to get a drink? Sure. Why not. What did you do today Satan? You don't care. Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love. Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK. That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down! Don't call me dumb! I mean cute dumb. Now bend over! No, you don't!  He does not work well with others. What do you mean?  What's he do? He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years. Our cemetery? Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go. Isn't she attractive? Very--your mother? Don't be a c-a-t. You asked me to dine with you tonight. Yes? Well, I can't. Don't rub it in. But I'll have cocktails with you. When? At seven-thirty? Sooner it you like. Okay. Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out. Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women. How many have you lost? I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it. And what about the ones you don't save? You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave. And what if you can't live with it? You've got to decide that for yourself. No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother. STEPHANIE? My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER - Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER? STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me... The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift. Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh? Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean? Blood . . . my . . . blood . . . Let's get you inside . . . . No more... I can't! Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly! Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars? Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me... Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying! It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives. However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right? Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason. I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone. Didn't mean to bum you out. That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself? Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it. Objection! And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives. You're interfaced with our dish. Gimme the coordinates? ... I'll buy you some new ones. You don't have any fucking money.. Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy? Shut the hell up. Why do you need my finger? Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower. And where are we? Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it? I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt? I don't have to but I find it natural. Suppress it. I'll try. Look. You're almost one of us now, Michael. She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house. Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible. He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks. I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father? And you didn't do anything about it? No.  I didn't. I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot. You're done.  End of story. I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool. You going to answer it? Uh-uh. Marlon-- --Truman, what are you doing here? Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking? I wasn't trying -- Is that bubble what I think it is? Where is Miss Wollsten? She's in her room. -- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that! The lockdown thing. I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just... -- it wasn't me. Rewind that. I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it. Then who did?? No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked! It works. Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart. No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it. Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time. Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War. ...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy. Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write. It was very well hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late. It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying. Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful. I don't hear any-- Shut up and listen! Let's go. Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out. What is Mac out? Follow me my Asian brother. You're late. You know how I like to make a big entrance. I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that. He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her. I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away. Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose. Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio. By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now? I'm a little late, that's all. How late? What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility. Exactly how late are you, Lynette? What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you? No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that. Listen -- I don't even know your name. Rath.  Robert Rath. Electra. Just Electra? Yeah. As in daughter of Agamemnon? No.  Just Electra. Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired... I don't understand. Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture... Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it? Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business... But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment -- Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed -- Isn't this Jack Groppi's place? Yeah.  But he ain't here now. Know where he is? Follow me. Are you asking me a question? Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms? How come you're not older? Angels don't get any older, son. And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this. How do you control the Morlocks? We make them see what we wish. How? As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated. Too bad we can't SMELL her. In space, no one can hear you sweat. I don't want to have anyone live through that night again. I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help. I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead! Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today. You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion! You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life. ...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace? Well... actually, no Bill... Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold. Stylin'! Keep going. The view had better be worth it. Well, what have you thought? Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free. I got my partner in there! I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more. So far? Yes, I'm right? Right. I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again? Again. Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn? Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right! See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?! It was amazing. Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on. Do you own a car? I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car. If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun. You don't? Nope. Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!! What's wrong? Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know. Mikey, I hoped... No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent. So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me. Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter  whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard. That was unfortunate. That was a calamity! Do you want some dinner? I'd love some. Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it? It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have  31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle. Oh my God, a mistake! It's not our mistake! Isn't it? Whose is it? Information Retrieval. Oh, good! Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer You like sports? It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent. What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation. Is that right? But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit. We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there. Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her. Oh, great.  And what happens to her? This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen. I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today. Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped. Yes, ma'am, it is. I'll give you fifty cents. That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars. Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper. Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez! I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me. Oh, I wasn't worried about that. No? I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band. Oh, yeah? He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. What? Who fixed your ducts? Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?! Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out. But you're thieves. It's what you are. Yeah. It's an esoteric journey. Of course I didn't tell Calloway. Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him. Did you feel that? Yes I did... Felt like a large asteroid. Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question? What is it, Mary? Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know. Thanks for everything, Dad. You sure you don't want a ride to work? It's just across the park. On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself -- And place my reputation at stake? Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now -- God is Great," yes? I'm born-again. There's our man. Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side. We seem to have a little problem here? What kind of problem? I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem. What are you saying? That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist? He had a mother and father -- and he knew them. One in a million, I suppose Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months - Please, Sidney, I can't stand this - And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French! That is sedition! Treason! That is the truth! I ought to have you whipped from this fort! Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement. What for? Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment. Yeah? Who is it? It's me, honey. It's Mom. How'd it go today? Good...I'm tired. Who is he? You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show. Where's it coming from? Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial. I would bet on it. The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers... Kyle, don't go! There's not much time left in the world, Sarah. Not that I can see. Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts. Got a pen on you? Why? There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor. I don't know if I can do that without a... I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead. Maybe we can save August... Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that? I was acting in the town's best interests... The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs. My kids were on that beach... Just sign it, Larry. I wasn't singing to myself. Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden. Mookie. What? How come you ain't got no brothers up? Ask Sal. Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here? I'm going to be a policeman. What's your name? William Simpson.  I like Willy. Good to know you, Willy. You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you? Yes.  I've missed it. No.  The world has missed you. What a place for them... Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above? Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days. I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful. Sire, I -- You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King? Did you call the State Police? All their lines were busy. Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there. Good luck, Austin. Thank you. Oh, and Austin... Yes? Be careful. Thank you.  Let's go, baby! But you're sure we've met, huh? Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled. Heineken. FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!! You lied to me. I'm sorry. You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home. No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed. I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet. Well, this isn't really a party per se. You don't celebrate til it's over. True. That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi? Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first. My pleasure. It was at least as good as the sky. Really?  Okay! And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious! Neat. Goodnight! This is nuts. Wade. You the sentry? Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners. Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her. I don't care what he thinks. Yes, this is Doctor Marrow. How'd I know it was for you? Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you. What the hell's that for? What's it for?? It's probably going to need stitches. I'm going to throw up. No, you're not. The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene -- -- who's married to -- Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back -- -- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't -- And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy -- -- who is the most competitive woman in the world -- Now, or he dies, please. Come on, Alice. Are they on the radio? Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best. How do you know? I manage them. Sir, that's great news. But how - Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name. I was here the whole time. You two better quit it. Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking? There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking. Do you think they ever existed? Yes I do. Do you want to become one? Become?  One is born a saint. Well you can try, can't you, to be good? Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles. We're asking you to go to prison. But I've never served a day. If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge. Awwh, Charlie. Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads. I can see him right now! Where is he, Donald? He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me. If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else. It's too late. I've already ruined my life. You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up. Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil. It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat. I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there -- Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key. It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning. And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut. That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over. Thank you, Mr. Dobisch. Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie -- Three. Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea? Who is it? Babe Brother. Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium. Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox. Red Sox... Who's on the mound? I don't know. Who do you want? Allie Reynolds. He's my boy. Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats? I know people. They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh? You get ketchup? Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want. I can't eat it with mustard. I really hate to bother him, but... Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired. Split it up. Any word on Donny? He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit. What happened to Sway? She left... Their com system must still be down. Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help. Oh no, it can't come now. It must come. No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little. I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this. Map is kinda dirty, Monster... They changed the layout. Sit down. Is everything okay? You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened. Thank you. About the alibi -- Something wrong with the stairs? Avoid-all-contact-day. What? When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day. You know her? Uh-uh.  Before my time. You're beautiful. Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face. Ah... I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like. I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind? Of course not. What about Larry -- Forget him. The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica. That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im. No shit?!?! You know him? Used to. What'd you say? No, of course. Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you -- Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing -- Preysing? I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad. I don't think I have to now. Where did that come from? I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes? I... I don't know... What don't you know? This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think -- Set what up? That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work. Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write? Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return. Let me see it again? We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong. Where'd you learn that? What? That. At birth.  I don't know you -- Harry D'Amour. I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you. I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann. What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business. Was he taking a lot of risks? You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way. Not the Walter Wilder? Is that your final answer? Yeah. Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight! You talk the lingo. What's your pitch? The long end. Big con. Nobody does that single-o. I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley. I've heard the name. It was beautiful. And getting better all the time. Is that right? It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game. Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape? Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A. Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig. I can come visit? You better! Yes! I will. It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs. So, um...how was your day?  What did you do? Well...  I declared war! Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common... That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do? He lied to me again. This is incredible.  I know kung fu. Show me. She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you... Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker! What the hell are you doing here?! I was with Jessie, she filled me in. Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in-- When we get this group down, I'm gone. You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something? I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it. Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you. Look, I know-- You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died. I did what I thought was right. Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it-- There wasn't time for anything else. We'll never know, will we? Look, it was a bad time for everybody. What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family. And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it! That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam. Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue-- Nope. And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid. Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing. Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus! Qual se tu? It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one. It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it. Magnificent. You are the first to find me. We sought only your infinite wisdom. And how did you breach the Barrier? With a starship! This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier? It could. Yes. Then I shall make use of this starship. It will be your chariot! Where's the car? I need to get something straight first. Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big. Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk. Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine. A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre. Another dab? Would not say no, would not say no. You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today. Great. What's the latest we can get there? About two-thirty. Okay. Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend? And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail. Enzo, stop bitching, will you? Shut the fuck up.  Hello? Yeah? Okay, listen-- Risky business, isn't it? ...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs... There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two! Wrong number? No, it's not. Hi, Mom. Shari, Ray feels -- You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks? So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is. Nineteen months I been sober. What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead. Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too. Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you. Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off. But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place. Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off. But who done it? Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now. Are you crazy? Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened? That's what I asked you, ain't it? Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities! Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory. Mr. President! Will the Senator yield? Will Senator Smith yield to--? You're keen on music? Yes!!! You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all. You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult. Do you want more rice? Maybe later. How about you? I'll make it five hundred! No! No!  EXT. FORT LEAVENWORTH - TEN YEARS LATER - DAY. You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals. That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today? Shoot. Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove? Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other. Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. Oh yeah? Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. Jeffrey!! Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment? Yeah. Jeffrey? Why? I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret. You like mysteries that much? Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much. It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something. Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet. Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds. Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too? Yes. That is to say  Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost? Oh - nothing. No extra charge. That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it? Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates. Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet. Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago. My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman. Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead. Yes, where? In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio. Ah-ha. John Ultramalensky, right? Right. God, I haven't seen you since the wedding. Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't -- Not mine, stupid. Yours. What are you doing here? Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero? You're crazy baby.  I love you. Are you my big hard hero? Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you? Oh yeah... Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you. Oh yeah? Let me heal you, baby. Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus. But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all. That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction. If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible? You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger. I'm sorry. I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you. Some of it good, I hope. Can you drive? Drive? I'm not old enough yet. It's never too soon to start. Nothing is real until it's perceived. The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium. How? Any news? Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication... I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother. What do you mean? Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone? Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York. I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks. Meaning what? You don't shoot squirrels. Public Domain. And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"? We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>. Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>? No problem.  Here's the... You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too. Print is dead. That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play? Is that a game? It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies? I collect spores, molds and fungus. Oh, that's very - unusual. I think it's the food of the future. Remind me not to go to lunch with you. Uh huh? Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter? Yeah. What is this going to cost? It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement... People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone-- On you, maybe. You don't believe in suicide. It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two... Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name. Thank you, son. Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing? Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant. Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid. Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle? Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident. Want a smoke? Why not? A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility. It's not that... it's not that... What do you mean? It's not my time of month. Should you see a doctor? I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished. For what? I don't know... I don't know... That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets. I don't like it. Why not? I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic. He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner. Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and -- -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it. I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? Marion. It's a book. Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it. It's the truth. Without hope there's no point to anything. Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative. Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it. Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl? Somewhat. Where does it make berth? Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is. The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it? Why ask me? Because you're a pirate. And you want to turn pirate yourself? Never.  They took Miss Swann. So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me. Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns? They're not guns.  They're particle throwers. Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em. I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone. Yes ...  It's just that ... What? Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that. Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not? You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it. I wanna play for Lonnegan. You know anything about him? Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know. How did those... ? You're part of it... What?  Connie... You better tell me what the hell's going on here! Hey, hey!! Take it easy!! They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened. You're pregnant? I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning! Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least. I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear. Terrific. But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back? I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks. Who? Michael Meyers. The serial killer? He's my brother. Don't wander off. What? It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch. As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends? My name's not Christine.  It's not my real... Who the fuck cares? I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down. About how fast was I going? You have his promise, then? Yes. Would you care to go topside? Very much. Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe. Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me? Later. I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man. Cease fire with the bullshit. Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right. Hi. Hi. Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me? To keep from being an old maid. You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town. I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you. You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what? My baby. Here's something. I didn't do that one... Hmmm. ... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse... You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt.. Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me... Only you... Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything... That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit? Who? You don't think I can do it. No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin! Hi. Hello. I'm Opal. Oh yes, I'm John Triplette. I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi. Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here. Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver. You read me, Brewer? Read you. Home on my strobe. All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged. Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other. It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here. He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long. Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip. Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee. What do you mean? Well.  There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.  That I kept instead. Shit. How far kin you see? You too are lonely. I ache with it. Let me comfort you. I cannot take comfort when she has none. Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight. I cannot betray my bride. One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price. I've got a hot one. You go, boy. If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville. Oh my lady, my love! If they find you here they will kill you. You can bring them with a word. Oh, not for the world! Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol? I'd hold that off awhile. Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him! So you did talk about it, huh? On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do? What do you suggest? I don t know. Everyone s dead... Your parents arranged the visit to my office? I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you. I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away. Now you and David... No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family. Let's go see them. No... no, everything's different now... So would I. It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know? What are those? Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix. What are they for? Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets. Who told you we deal drugs? I'm just concerned about my daughter. You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you. What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy? That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block. You d better get going. My parents will be  round to cart you off to the country. Whatever you do, don t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf. Your probably best off pretending you re asleep. Don't you knock? They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone? Actually I'm feeling up to leaving. Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!! No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself! Everybody I ever worked with, did time with. They fucking know everything. Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet-- I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter. Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude. Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll. Have it your way.  The point is-- It's your roll-- The fucking point is-- It's your roll. Satisfied? Open the bag, dump everything on the table. So I hear you're taking some time. Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit. Where're you going? I don't know. India maybe. Why there? Never been. Hello? Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over. NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever. What? Is there someone else? You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees... Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be. Hi Brandon. No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads. Oh.  Okay. You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right? I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels. We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable. God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this. A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City? Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers. Evildoers, huh?  Big or small? Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent. Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet? Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close. It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free! Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long. I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way! Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is. But you're just like the characters in the stories. Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books? You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want. So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it? You're not married, are you? What do you think? No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were. You're probably right. Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis. I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother... Oh, here we go... TALBY! Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it? He's gonna make it. No way.  Not possible. Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you. You can both go take a flying jump. Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile. Why do girls like that always like guys like that? Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted. He always have that shit-eating grin? Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out. What is that? What does it look like?  It's an address book! Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you. I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired. Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today. Oh . . . I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit. I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway? Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess. Hi. I, uh, think that's us. Hi. I'm Jimmy. Bobby. So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word. Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery. Looking to score? Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high. Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block. Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh... Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys. You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew? Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens. KHAN! Have you discussed this with anyone else, John? No. Not even with Exley? Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith? I admit, I know nothing of your culture. Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal. Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others. Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain? Show this to the President. You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...? Hold on a second. I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did? How do you like flying? It's wonderful.... Think you can sleep? Are you gonna steal my shoes now? No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep. I don't know what I'm so scared of. Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . . How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you. I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference. It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport. Sport, indeed. The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face. Blackheart.  Aptly named. Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn? Unicorn? A promise is a sacred oath. All right.  I'll show you something sacred. So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me. Oh no, no... Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor. I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you... So what firm you with, pal? Jackson, Steinem... ...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal. ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff. ...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know? Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko. So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here? How are the others? The others, sir? Beth and Harry? They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting. Yeah.  CIA-level stuff... And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you? Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow... The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky-- --I saw what I saw. Yeah. Me too. The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with-- --into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here-- --Domini! It's gonna be beautiful. Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'? Mr. Clear Moon. Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here. Are you serious? Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator.... No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic. I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you? Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money. We have to do something. We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know. I know, I know.... And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one. It's still a good idea. Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke. Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers.... A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident. Two of them are still missing! There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims? Maybe they are! Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it. But Bela Lugosi's in it! Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got? They d never let me go. And you d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me. You cannot walk away from this. You cannot. I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband? There may be a hunting party. Why, there's nothing on the news? I didn't mean police. How the hell did we get this detail? Guess it's our turn. I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening -- He killed them? Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in -- I have followed my feelings. You are reckless! As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune. Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream? Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget. I'll walk you out. Are you serious? Yeah. He said that. Where's the bloody - - torque wrench. - this is very disconerting.. Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told. - right.. Are you an Epileptic? No, sir. They're my friends. Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training. Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond. Never, why do you ask? I skipped lunch. Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat. Okay then... Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that? I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think? Not me. But other people seem to. Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it. Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you? No... Actually, you look more like a cop. I'm going with you. Okay. Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview. No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America. OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby. Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport. My jumbo jet? Smashing baby. Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"? Back is in New York. Your wife knows that, don't she? Sure. Cut it out. The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that. Can I help? You heard her - yes. Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now - That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life? Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you. The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way. Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it? Yes, naturally. Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich... Aren't you forgetting about something? You are, and it's behind you. Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for -- Small moves, Captain, small moves. I can't move any smaller. Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding. What do you think? Ecru. And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print? Daddy? Yes, darling. Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you? Give in to despair and all is lost. It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap. There's more than one way to spring a trap. Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait. The man who was with him, he was a construction worker? Yes. What did he look like? I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember. How did you know he was a construction worker? He had an orange hat on. . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue... Charlie? Was I dead? I thought you were...for a while. You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old. But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue. Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you. I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you. What about Janet? That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger. You never had The Talk, did you? No. Well, this was another way to go. How about a lift home? Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat. What is it Keaton? Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open? I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby? Yeah.  And it might have even worked too. Let's do it again. We were good when you bailed, weren't we? Very good... Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process. No way ... No ... ? No ... At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together. You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy! I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything. He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight. Don't.  It's horrible. Nonsense! She got at she deserved. That's because you had a proper upbringing. That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to! Oh! And don't wave your hands about! Respect your elders and your betters! And no elbows on the table! Eating is eating... and... And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on. Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares. Scooby, don't! Be careful! I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV. I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why. You should be. What the hell are you doin'? Get your clothes off. What are you talking about? I'm freezing. Get your clothes off! How did you get this gig? My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot? This is a TV show, not a music video. Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no? This is a travesty.  A debacle. I had everything. Once. So what happened? Life knocked me back. I came into this world flat on my ass. And now you have everything. No. Not everything. Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes. I guess I am. Just a little. What do you mean? Scared. Vayanse. You others, go on. Sir-- Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go. Sir, you can't just-- DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH. ...Well, I'm not sure where I -- I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important! But look, I'm president of the company now and I -- I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now! I'm embarrassed. The list is so long. Be specific. Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?... Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste. We don't have time to argue, Susan. How's the weather for pickup tomorrow? Beautiful. I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race. Get away from him! No. No way. Ahem. Vada, just put 'em on the stool. Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right? Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on? Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while? What is it? Stay back. They've got Jean-Louis! That sounds like their problem. I'll be right there. I just wait. You know? Huh? I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year. So do I. You do? Yeah. -- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time -- That's what everybody says. I'm not everybody. That's what everybody says. All done. Honey this is Father Dyer. Hi Father. You take this.  I ain't hungry. Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today. I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry. You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it. Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent. You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you. I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie... Mr. Sulu? Stan! Stan are you okay?! Wendy? Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you? Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss. Look, Harlin. Darrell. Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk. Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient. He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him. That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves. Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people. Who are you really? That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else... I don't think we have any alternative, Captain. I see.  What do you think our alternatives are? We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system. Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . . Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story. I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic. No, sir. Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition. Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can. We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite. Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son. ...and who was Benjamin Franklin again? The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla. I didn't know that. Welcome to public school, my friend. Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart? When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee? A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States. And he invented fire. You know Bill is really mad at you. Oh? I mean... Mary? They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech. Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet. It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be? Be very, very quiet... Are you hunting wabbits ? Not good. How you doin? Not good. Didn't I teach you to always arch your back? Yes, Master. Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you? Eight, almost nine years. And did you have a close personal relationship? Yes... And how did you find his work? It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler. And yet you fired him. - it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say- Where'd you get all that information? Eve. Eve? She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her... That was a pity... She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo... I wonder why. Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers. You are like  Pop! You know how to work this thing? No idea. Well, press something! Wait! No, I mean, no big whoop. I can't do this. JUST SING! Sing! Why are we leaving? Those checks take forever. I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project. Where are you? Lo, Ed. Hello, Walter. Come to look around? More or less. I'll take you about. Got some nice things. Spare me. Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck. Shit! INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages. Then, he must write about these murders. What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what was intended. I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem. Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away. Did you do it? I think so. Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds. Ricky Tan is alive. What?!?! We have to get to the Penthouse. Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is... Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night... Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie? Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale. You go out much? After four years and now the question comes up. Couldn't handle it then. Now I can. I'm still here, Doc. I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday? Ahh... my wife's. Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life. It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years. What happened? It was horrible. He called me up. Who? Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him -- So you had sex with him? What can we do? Nothing -- against all that force. You ain't even a man yet. That ain't what your mama said. Sorry.  I don't know anything about it. Come on, gimme a break. I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth. Ray Barboni? Who is this? Are you the guy they called Ray Bones? Depends. Who's this? Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you? What three hundred grand? The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession. Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee. I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll. What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you? Would you like to talk to the manager? Did you hear that? Hear what? Oh, Nick... Nick! Hello, Mimi. want to talk to you about something very important. I'm going back for Taylor! Are you nuts!  It's too risky! I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it. Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people. I'm sorry. Yes... Can you make it back? Oh my... I'll try. What?  No menthol? Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then. That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right. I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security? I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research. Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much. Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going. What did you do? I put her to sleep. H... how? I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can. I don't mean to go on and on like this. It's OK.   It's good to let it out. JOSH! JOSH! Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it? Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately. It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think? Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one. How you be? I be.  I'm living large. Is that the only tape you got? Are you nervous? Au contraire, mon cher. I've often thought about going back. You have? Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain. He sounds like a person worth while knowing. Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you. Aubrey?  It's mommy. You're dying to come into my room, aren't you? You want me so bad, why don't you invite me? Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones? I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie... What's up? Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection. It's not necessary. I know. That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing. What happened? Honey. What were you doing with that? I... I don't remember. I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore! All right. Be careful. You fucked with me for the last time! Okay, yeah. What are you talking about? Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor. I don't know ... Please. She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral in her book. We have to meet. One hour. I didn't kill Officer Harrison. I know. How? Did they figure it out after I died? No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them. He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand. He'll be dead when he does. Sorsha. Madmartigan. Edith was just telling me about her job. I'm a file clerk. Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain. Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet... She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed. Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred... My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house. Well we gotta do something! Where is she then? She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know. Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this. Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie? No thanks. Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now. Let me be the judge of that, Madam. Yes. Well. She's upstairs. Who else knows about this? Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right? Show me again... Okay... Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive? Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road. I don't get it... this really was my turf... You're not a kid anymore. My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."  And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper."  Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all. Thank you. No problem. No.  Thank you. You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense. Yeah. Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"? Sure, all the time, in Group. In Group? Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA. Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense. Intense. How long were you in there? Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated. Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink? No. Oh, maybe. Fuck. I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab. Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first. It was pretty bad, huh? It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me. In case you ve forgotten.  I m dead already. Haven t you heard the news?  So is she. Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but -- That's where you're wrong.  I will change it. I've got it!  Astounding! What? No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still. Yes you can. How? I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie... Mr. Sulu? You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it. You? Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction. I know whose blood you need, to end the curse. Say the name, or I slit your throat. No you won't. How' he doing? Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration? No they're not. Annabelle put down that camera. Have a cigar. Thanks. We gonna jump or jerk off? My man! Clarissa left those here. I won't tell mom if you don't. When did you start smoking? You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man. Okay.  These are good. I helped. Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open? Probably come through the wall I suppose. Well maybe we can do something like that. I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass. Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence! So, you still picking apart cockroaches? No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises... You're still mad at me, aren't you? You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad. That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know. Most people don't. I'm sorry you feel that way. What's he smoke in that? Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament. ...I love you more'n more, ever day. That's very nice. Are you all right...? I... You got to get out of here... I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him... You don't have to... I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it-- So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk-- What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to? Well, I like to try to get all points of view. It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider? Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired. God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning. In a computer program. The new world. It's not real. Not real? His legend grows! It will be worse than before! You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this. Uh-huh. After you, Junior. Yes, sir!  Haaa! Where is he? He's inside you, where he hides. He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him. It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried. I should've put them out of the car and come sooner! When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know. That's weird -- What? He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up -- I think I'll go to bed. Oh. Well, goodnight. Won't you unzip my dress? I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson. If you still think I'm trying to seduce you -- No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny. Benjamin -- you've known me all your life. I know that. But I'm -- Come on. Who are you working for? I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have? Twenty percent. Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family. Whatever you say. Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back -- Shut up and do it! Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it? It's fantastic -- it's too much. It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever". I know.  Thank her for me. It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit -- Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit. So you do eat pussy! Naw naw! You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it. Hello. Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl. You've got her? Where? Do you remember the figures we discussed? Of course I do. Where are you? At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here? Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well? Either that or she'll be in jail. What are you talking about? Just bring your checkbook. Sounds like you, Hicks. The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly -- You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird. Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help. Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way. Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop. I guess not. That must be him. A daisy for the lady. The lady knows this is a dandelion. A rose is a rose. Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom. Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns. Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am? I think you're Nick the Greek. What? I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut. I had to tell 'em something. Never say anything unless you have to. Thanks for the invite. Got anything to drink in there? Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies. What just happened? All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing. You've got to put this on. Take laddie. Huh? Save Laddie first. Pharmacy crowded? I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood? No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT-- I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! Hello? Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing. Really? How much? I ve got a shadow. Can you lose him? No.  Abort. They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen. Maybe not, but why take chances? Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and -- Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out. I can appreciate that. So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane. Lobotomy Bay? You've heard of it? So, how do I fit into this scheme? The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you? By all means. You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback... There's no one in the corridor but us. Not according to the computer. You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o! He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now... Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo! OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds... Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right? You goin' back inside? One thing I need. You have my word... Get out of here, then. Now. What are you doing? Loading a gun. What for? Kill myself. Are you crazy? Yep. Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head. Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too. You're not crazy. Hear voices don't I. Of course you do! Then I'm crazy. Ready? Just gettin' rid of the garbage. I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter. We're very lucky. The funeral's on Friday. Did you have so little interest in seeing me? To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ... You have no feelings toward ... No. We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours. Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!! Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man? Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores. I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records. Do you know what's in this archive? How could I know what's in the archive? Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement? All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is. What do you mean, demons? He told me he was going to Hell. Kill him! No! Kill him! I advise you to let us go. You advise us! You're out numbered son. You sure you wanna go there? Uh...maybe? Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian! Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I? But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe. No, I'm concerned with everything. But I'm the one up there on the screen. That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act. I can't go with you. What? I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals. You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here! The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood. Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck. You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out. Hey--I want to ask you something. Shoot, Jimbo. Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it? Is there some kind of trick answer? What would you do, Dad? I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject. Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck. Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer. Well... the guy's fucked up. I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with. Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John. This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed. What did? The old Indian burial ground. They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother. Our daddy raised Pure Herefords. Cheer up, darling. I'm sorry. Detective Niccoletti? What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.? How do they know that, you told them? No. What did you say to them...? I didn't say anything to them. How do you know you saw it? I don't know. Well, then, you didn't see it, right...? I don't... You didn't see it... I...?  I saw it.  I was there. You were there.  At...at 10:35...? Hey. Hey. You got a dog? It's not ours.  It's George's. Ellis Loew. What about him? Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this. Getting drunk is no solution. Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room. Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles. Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here. No thanks, I quit. You quit? Yeah.  Where you headed? Work.  Going to work. Look at this! What about it! Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell. That coke was yours, wasn't it? Say it. We're beat! No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to... Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet. Can you help me get her back? Look, I'd really like to... I'm glad you agreed to see me. I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings. Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on. Oh. How's work going?    Are you back at school? I start on Monday. Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand? Cockroaches? Sam!!! Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ... Not now ... please Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes. Jackie - what are you talking about? Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery. It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place... So they'll go. I'm only paying two of you guys. It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means? I told you, that's a secret. Isn't he precious? Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on? Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end. Hurry, Grandmama! Get on! Anastasia, get on! There. Oh -- I'm Allison, you're 'honey'. Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away. I don't know. Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.

So I can watch them wilt? He paid for 'em. MAMA! Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up. But mama.. Go upstairs I said!! Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose. Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans. My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow. We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place. Yeah, some deal I made. I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And... You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find. Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say. Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment. And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think. Do you have a pot or a bucket? Sure. So... what is the message? We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles. She wanted me to tell you-- Cole, please stop. She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance. I gotta get out of here. You just stay put.  You need rest. You don't get it, he's after me... Don't worry, honey Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV! What? I'm Crash Override. You're the moron that's been invading my turf? Is there anything you do know? I know you're a pussy.  I know that. You want ME to go up there? Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine. And what if I run into one of those things? Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou - Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye... Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while. We should go to the Metro it's quicker. Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on! Well do you disagree with that? Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site? Oh well, if that's how you feel about it. Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever. That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. Maybe I should wait... No, open it... I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads. You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about? What's your bartlett's? It's a quote book. Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy? Keeping my eye on Sidney. Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed. Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned? There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man. Have you contacted the bureau? They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house. You think he could still be in town? He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney? She's with my sister. Should I bring her in? Hold off for now. Just stay close to her. She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight. Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out. Yes, sir. Kind of isolated. Yeah.  It's kind of nice. Can we go now? Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do. To be a hero? Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog. I had to. Didn't I? Couldn't you've just pulled him off me? No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought -- Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me. ...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti... It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date. Out!!!! C'mon Johnny. You getting out too? Yeah, thanks, it's ok. So, what's he like? Well, he's young and he's healthy. I want to die...  No, I don't! Row! Row! Row! You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say. Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do. He must have been great-looking, right? Why do you say that? Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom. What happened? You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left. So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it. But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be? You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish? That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn. Hey Doc!  Come on now. Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything. Of what?? Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy. What's going on, Kay? I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds. The radio show? No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards. You think that's what's-happening? I think that's what's happening... Do you think George is a fairy? Who? That kid... the hairdresser. Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser. Rick...I can't. Never say can't.  Just do what I do. Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it? It was. Unless Daddy comes back later. Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right? Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma. Tripp. Yes. Hit your brakes. It doesn't seem to be in any hurry. He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's -- Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM! How did you know that? I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa! So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel. We go underwater? Well, Mr. Green. Hi, Sherry. How'd you get in here. You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore-- Shut up! What does it say? It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica... What you say? He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day. Rancho Cucamonga? Yeah. Is this... choir practice? Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell. So he knows your name? I told him. Are you all there? We finally graduated, big dude guy! Alright! Found somethin' worse than me, huh? We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now. No further questions. You may step down. Hi. can I come in? Yeah. hurry up though. Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance. And the marriage - is that a fiction? No, the marriage isn't a fiction. And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu. Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it. Conan went to Harvard. Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident. What are you doing up here? I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster. Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant? Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt. Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip. A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow. Sam ... you haven't had dessert. I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything. Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams. Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work. That's good. And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop. Yes, you said. Now, are you going to have some more tea? No, thanks Dad. Or a beer.  I've got some in. We're never gonna make it. Shut up and open the door. I don't think so. Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off. Yeah. You just need to get more organized. L Do you think it's done? I don't know. Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment? God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him. I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail. We should call him and pretend to be the redhead. Oh, we totally have to. It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program. Yeah it was all just an accident. Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here... Don't you even think about it. The place is falling apart. I'm doing fine. Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff. I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here. One guy do all the damage? Yeah. Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective. Todd, what's the matter? It's my birthday. It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything? What -- ? Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me... She does have one thing you don't. What's that? Bench seats. You have been lonely? I am lonely, Yuri. Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice. The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher. I had a teacher like that once. Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character... Who wants true? Who wants moving? Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while. Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around. I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas. I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little? As for instance? Well.... We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower? How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door? Are you hungry? Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder -- Phillip, you're mad! That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to -- Right, whatever, have fun. You don't understand, I can get us information... Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey? I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout. I know! You helped me go from a six to a four! Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane. Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss - Could I see you a minute? Sure!  Excuse me. I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it. Luke! What? Luke needs help.  We must go back. Tell Frick and Frack that means them too. I'll be alright. You! ... You knew about this? No, I swear -- I never saw this man before. You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes! Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop? A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either. It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now? I don't know, sir. Well, find out.  Who's covering her? Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty. If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning. We don't have much choice then, do we? Over three-hundred. I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money. If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand. I don't expect to live that long. No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it. Like this? What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed? Wait. How about this? Now you're squinting like you need glasses. I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called. He did? When? While you were in the shower. Why didn't you call me? He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case. What? What do you mean? He said you didn't have one. What's he talking about? I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said. I don't believe this. Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something. It's got Hazy! What has? One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!... Have we met before? No. Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things, Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield. Maybe... I... don't... What about Philip Swann? I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar. Listen to it for Christsake. Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here... I haven't had fun like that since college. I'm sorry. Why? I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die. You're too human, Blade. It's because I'm human that I can do this. I have to talk to you. What do you want? Come on.  Let's get a drink. Don't touch anything. Hello, I'm Candy Gulf. How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in. Who's the girl? Jewish... How do you know? You mean a misfire? I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer. I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off. Maybe... You never told me how your parents met. They met at Auburn. What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that. That's because most of it never happened. But it's romantic. You doing okay? Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now. Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious. Yeah, you still with Northland? Foreman now. No shit. Five years. Beautiful. How's business? Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys... Watch it!  Move back. Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away. Ah hell, he'd do the same for me. Has he? No.  But he would, probably. Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now! Are you finished?  You okay? Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day. What is it? A tranquilizer? A stimulant. Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now! Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field. Depression? Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce. Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist? Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks. And those lies she's been telling? Lies? Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff. Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities? Never. Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter- Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil. You're kidding! Like what? Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive. Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance! Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby! Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home. He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent. What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack? There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend. Have we been invited? Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday. I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty. I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either. You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton. You're terrible. I know.  But I'm the only father you've got. We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden... If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued - If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse. You're all hear. I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think? Fuck you. And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing? God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard? If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again. You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down. Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master? Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment. Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are. What do you mean? I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals. What is this place? A liposuction clinic. What you readin'? Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye? Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl? I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is. I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it. Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time. Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then. It's beautiful. A little dusty. So what do you need, Fergus? Need to go across the water. Do you now. Need to lose myself awhile. Aha. Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you. Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance?? What did you wish for, honey? I already got it. Everything I want. You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore. We can't pretend this isn't happening. Please -- not now. Why didn't you come to me? I don't know. You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me. It's more involved than that. It was a place to start. You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you? I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are. What's in your socks? Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes. We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood. What are you going to do?  Drink it? Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say. And no one found the ring? No, sir, we did not. Aren't you even curious? Engine 115, right? How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed. Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments. You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115? Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station. Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother? I'm Cindy. I'm Hanson the caretaker. So why're you even considering it? Are you? Just like you would be. Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan. I take it you don't either.  Feet. Calvin! Coming! ...What do you mean, you decided not to park here? Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here. Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service. I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer. Lava? No. What are they? I don't know. You know what else? What? I can tell that she had just entered puberty. How? Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right. Right. And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little. Yeah. And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup. Hey... Hey where are you going? We have no right to do this. They deserve to know. Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no! John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible. Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun - It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel. I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try. I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems. You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem. I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not. I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes.... I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them. Thanks, Dad. Give me one minute. You've got it, Wendell. Hey baby... Peanut... Jack, you don't use a gun, do you? Not until recently. Nervous? A little. This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you? You're right.  So why take a chance-- I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now. No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back. There's no need. It's no problem. No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem. I'd really rather take care of it myself. Spud, they're my sheets. Yeah, it's working out real good. Where's Emmett now? Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject. It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them. Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me. You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes. You are such a wet. A what? A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'. Don't start with me again. Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever? Buffy... And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color. What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy. Oh, fuck you! A fine choice, sir. Excellent! Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships... Christ almighty. ... and then he, uh... took the other one. What? He... took it. We can't really bring another family in here with us. Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good. When did you talk to Harry? Don't shout! ...what kinda car's Jasmine drive? Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black. Yeah? The sport utility? Uh-huh. Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person? Better. Oh fuck... I was afraid you weren't coming. I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing... That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings. No.  A deal's a deal. You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute". Are you even really alive? My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard. Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said... They wouldn't be a bit surprised.. So, how was I? It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about. I'm hungry for a proper visit. Don't start -- Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole... Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right? Men!  Are you up for it? What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha? You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal. So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins? Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem. Right. We better watch him. He's crazy. Right. I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me. Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in. You really think that's what happened? I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement. You mind if I take a look at this? Be my guest. Oh. Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey. Well, hi! Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets. Oh, yeah, really, oh! I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot. Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot. Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now? No, no, no, not at all. Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance. What do you want? I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd. You smell gas? Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here. Jesus. Hey, it's the best way to tell. Klingon blood. They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here. This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory. Now we go to Starfleet? Now we expand our search to include uniforms. ALL uniforms? I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense. It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did. There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING. You're lying...! I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me. Starck... Cooper... Hey, you're right. You're hopeless. That's the way I see it, too. What's your take? What's the point?  It's going down. Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine... Do something for me. What? Appreciate something. What? Look at me... What? My eyes are open. How long has it been, Uncle Alfred? Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter. Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful. What? Bye. Monica! Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together. Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly. What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged. Loretta, what are you talking about? I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me! Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show. For rabbits?  ...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl... ...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays. You're really serious, aren't you? Yes, I am. But what about the past? Our past? We never really shared one. You're inhuman. I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me. What gives? Nothing. Where are you going? Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library. Your court order, Dr. Allen. You know I'm not comfortable with this. But your patient is legally entitled to it. This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures. It's the patient's request, doctor. I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient. Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified. I think I should join you. He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome. Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock. Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls. Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going? We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham! And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens. Lucky throw, fire boy. Luck, my ass. You're loosing your cool I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this. Where's luther? Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy. Hello. And goodbye. Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up. What? Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars. The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us -- Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming. That's better than gold when it's cold. Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"... My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together. Stay? They lived together all their years? Oh, yes... I think... Mr. Caiman, you're married. And you're beautiful... Mr. Caiman... Call me Charlie. Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace. So have dinner with me tonight. I can't. It's your choice. Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two. We need to hurry. You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck! What? What now?! Wait a minute ... Fucker hit into us. Hey, asshole! That's not cool! Throw me his ball. I think there's an angle. An angle? Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer. But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her? I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician. She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible! That is incredible. Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead. I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken. I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings? We're just not a very musical nation... No, no... It was very... er, nice. Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it? That was a long time ago. And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that. She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride! Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? They could put you back in the tube.. I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance. Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you. They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need. Yeah...Who is? I am. You are. You are CRAZY! You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own. What do you mean we. You gotta help. I did. I brought you back here. We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility. Thanks. Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here. I'm not leaving until you do. But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want. We taking bets?  What if you're wrong? The ride is free. You got a deal. I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die? What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now. My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it? Two o'clock. Where's my dress? I have to go home. He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie. Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with. Big day last night. Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself. This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and - Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother... Which direction? That way. Any particular reason? None at all. Oh, Mom, it's so ugly. Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed. Jake! How's it going? Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way. I can't... make it... podner. I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal. Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business. Something on your mind? No. When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school? I did not go to high school. Weren't there high schools in El Salvador? We had to work. My family was poor. Must've been hard being poor. I'm still poor. Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything? No, Mikey. But like, what do you like to do when you're not working? I'm always working. But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do? This is work. But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting. So sorry. I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone. Yeah. Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives? As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden. ... In the garden? That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again... ... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner? But I do have a theory... I thought you might. An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away. A photon torpedo? Aye. Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command. It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant. Lucky it didn't step on his head. The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman. Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition? I won, I won!!! Oh great!! Do you love me, Michael...? Yes.  I love you.  Very much. I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you. Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home. I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way? You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK? Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up. I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles. You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner. I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms. What the fuck did you bring that for. In case. In case of what? In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say? Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp - I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it. Any damage? Minimal. Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong -- Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics. You are an academic. Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk. You think I'm all talk, Eddie? It doesn't matter what I think. Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all? She must be some girl. I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her. As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character. They are my friends. Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother? Tell her I feel fine... Double-strength! Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest! I'm sorry, but... the Stones... They are... with me... Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true? Yes.  Yes, of course it is. Then you still love me? Poppy, please, just tell me what you want. Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are. Damn right, but where the hell were you? What are you talking about? Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened? Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them? Yes. Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth. What are you talking about? Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison. A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?! Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet? To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century. Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think? Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago. Why, Brad? I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about. Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it? No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all. Well, don't get carried away. I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it. Good, I love swinging a shovel. Thanks, Pops. I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son. You cool, Ich? Cool? You all right?  You okay? Billy, what's the matter? My passport! No! I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup. He is not wrong. Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one. Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea? White meat will be fine... Look at this! He won't let us leave! Who? The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him. Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it! I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream? What's the "bad" part? I might wake up. <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy! I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life. Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off -- Johnny. Already. Greed.  It was written in blood. Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca. This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca. That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France. Occupied France? Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me. What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past. There are only two other alternatives for him. What are they? It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here. And the other alternative? My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle. Mitch... Shhh. Shhh. You have an unusual hand. I could have told you that. You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split. Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman. Not any woman, Marie.  Just one. Barks a doleful farewell. I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over. You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you? Nobody can help me. You, least of all. If I understand what you meant by that. You understand perfectly. Then there isn't much I can do, is there? There isn't anything you can do. I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member. Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends. Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino? Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus. Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow. ... He ought to put him in here. It's too soon to move him. So tell Calvin. I did.  He wants it on exhibit. Well, that's why you got it. Are you alright? Pigsty. Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better. Pig died. Who the fuck's Pig? My dad died.  My dad, my dad. Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate. It truly is. Ninety-three miles an hour. He looks wonderful, Jackson... It's Charlie! What a treat. More metal... sharp edge... Stay to your left. I can't believe his mother let him come over here. Right. Well, she didn't, exactly... Oh.  I... where's Louise? She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend. That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely. We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames. We really had a good time. Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here? No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know... Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes. What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now? Get out of the car. What's with you? Get out of the fucking car. Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song. You said. Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm... I don't know what you're talking about. He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk. What? You... I got what I paid for. You didn't mind too much. No! You want to come on in? Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you? Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead? From a slipped disc? That'd be a first. I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis. Well, I'll see what I can do about it. I've seen it. It's all pain. You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side. No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel. But I feel The Force flowing! Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring. This is wrong in so many ways. You've been working out. Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness? You use their witness. That's right. I think we tried that. The case is over. JOE Or what? I don't know. I don't want to find out. Eric! Are you here? Eric! She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is. Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below. She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her. The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all. I will find her! A little of both. Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested. Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need. Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work. Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly. That was Gary Cooper, shithead... No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes! Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy? Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked. When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean? We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there. You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch. I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town. I call him the boy with the ice cream face! It's really you, isn't it? Yeah...I think so. Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning. No, no that was Cadet Dunbar -- You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right. What's up with this shit. I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older. She's terribly hurt . . . Somebody's got to help us! They're requesting visual communications, sir. Let them eat static. They're still running with shields down. Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space. I'm a very patient man. That's great.  Good for you. Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know? Could you be a little more specific? Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you? Because I'm the one who's single. I never even got to be single. Sure you did. Not if you don't count the sixth grade. Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here? We understand. All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop. Was it you? I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub. Right. Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this? Pheasant. You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic. Why are you here? I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal. You're a long way from Inverness. In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth. You know me home.  Me name. It was time for our paths to cross. What's his problem? That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman. You okay, man? What? You okay?... What's wrong? You wanna get caught spying on Albert? No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert. You're sure you know what you're doing? Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down! Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios. Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live. I am? I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ... You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ... Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ... Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them. I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ... Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this. I don't know... It'll be my last chance.  Pleese? Did you get some sleep? Sure. Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something. Where's the girl? Upstairs. Why? I want to see her. ...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her? No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping. Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us -- Maybe we can catch it. I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one. I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you? Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus. It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore. All right boy: where's the money? In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor. It's a fake. Give him the card. But-- Can you follow simple directions? It's insane. Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day... If it worked. If it worked, yes. Bacon, see what we got. Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden. Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home? Helloooo... I'm only looking out for you. And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke. I don't understand. She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment. I think you better put that away. I think you're right. Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals. But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me! I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now. But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to. With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony. He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it... You're very good at this aren't you? I think you're supposed to answer that question. Jack? Yeah. Where are we going? I'll tell you when we get there. Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!! Yeah, it's like tradition or something. Right.  That gives us... Exactly three weeks to the day. My God, what happened here? You feign ignorance? WHAT HAPPENED? You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES! Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick. It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later. You didn't look then, the way you look now? Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben... Got it, teach. What do we do? Wait. What if they get in here? They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't. I heard you. Feel okay? Yeah. Shaky? Nope. Chills? Huh uh. I heard you playing. I often do. I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently. Why did you come in here? I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how. What happened?  What happened? Tommy, what happened? Jesus Christ. Well...wow... Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952. Yes? You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League. Are you? Talk to her, Sidney... Talk to her yourself... Hi Vada. Hi, wanna ride bikes? Sure. Finish your tour? And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria? Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain. Listen to that shit, that's good shit! Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit.

Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have. Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there. Yeah? Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe. They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright? They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make. What is it, Rose? It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was. What'd you do, Rose? Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so... You were pretty bad, huh? Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill. But, Rose, what is the cause of it all? Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind! But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen? I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me. You can't kill me yet. Why? I could be lying. Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns. May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' -- You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over. -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch. See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting! People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it! If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.  That's good enough for me. Me too. Where are my men? Dead. Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right? We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected. What honey? Fuck it. Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend. Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something. I have no right to answer that. What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth? You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"? I am now. Glad I could be of some help. When you do this, I swear... ...Don't get all... ...like it never even happened... Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just... I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see. Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here. No, not again. I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now. No!  I've got...reserve reserves! Could you tell me where you were last night? Here.  I played Gregory Lutz. I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that? To my room and then I went for a walk. Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you? Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead? From a slipped disc? That'd be a first. I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis. Well, I'll see what I can do about it. I've seen it. It's all pain. You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side. Why do you call him that? Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing. What do you mean? After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing. He requested this? He gets off on it. Sylvan can be talked into anything. Why do you say that? Like you said-she snowballed him. Sylvan? No; I snowballed him. Yeah, right. I'm serious... Hey, that's the guy- We just got a bomb threat upstairs. ... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money! For what? For money. For money for what? I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that? How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management. I think you just put your finger on it, I do. My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her... The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country. When is he to go? This is something. It's a smelting retort. You're not going out right away, are you? Waiting for Andy. I want you to meet my cousin. I will, I will. Bud! Where you been the last two days? ...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent... Oh no -- oh no!! You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner. Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off! Tom? You can come on. They gone. We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John? We re almost done here... Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised. That s right.  Okay, let s make a quick stop at the kids  shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I ll run into the linen store... I can't fuckin' do this. Are you alright? Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old. Donuts here any good? I don't eat junk food. Yeah-- Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley. Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop? None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards. Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home. Yeah.  Maybe he'll call. What do we got? 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside. Any verification on numbers. We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for. What have you promised them? Just that I'd talk to my superiors. Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia? More than likely. Not here. To the airlift. To the airlift. Any sign of the goddess Barrington? Not yet you know any of these people? One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA. Nonsense. What did you say? The driver was killed. I think there's a connection -- No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley? Yeah. Why, you know him? Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!... So the chest is still out there somewhere. Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything. This band sounds terrible. Coming? What use am I? We go someplace dangerous. Why didn't you say so? Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed. What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't. No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at. What variables? Like, you know, giving blow jobs. What's the big deal? Well I never did it. There's nothing to it. You're alive? No.  He got tired of pretending. Oh, Sean -- The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad. Sean -- I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me. I forgive you. Once I even told him I loved him. I forgive you... The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled. I was looking for you... I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me. I wanted to. Good-bye, Dad... You're not safe anywhere nowadays. But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you? You can trust me. Yes, Baron. Thank you. ... you want to be Margo's new understudy. I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly... Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays. The show must go on. No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy... Do you think Miss Channing would approve? I think she would cheer. But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson- They'll do as they're told. You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy! I-I-I... What's he so excited about? Yeah, showtime for what? What are you talkin' about? Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss. Mr. Roebush? Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow? Tuesday. TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!! I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag. Get a ride with somebody. Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself. What a guy. It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up. What's she doing? She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit! As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor.... There's a shark.... Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you. I didn't mean with me. That "thing" gets me excited. The things that get you excited. According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living. What are those mirrors for? Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see. On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last? She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today. Been sending her meals in regularly? Yessir. She refuses them all. Why didn't you jam it down her throat? It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one  Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself. So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck! Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think? Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize. Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma. They found this in Dickie's place in Rome. You gotta stop smoking .. I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ... I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can .. How'd you do it, old man? Someone bet me a dollar .. A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar .. ...Not far, now. Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last! Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone. What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you? No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out. Hello. Hey. It's me. Where are you? We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late. How late? No. Just like an hour or so. What about the chairs? Okay. What okay? What! The chairs. I left a message. I think it's going to be okay. You sound funny. Did you do cocaine? No. No. I'll see you in about four hours. George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them. But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore. Thanks, Pollux. For what? For being one helluva guy. Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up. Business or pleasure, Mr. Price? My wife. Where were we? Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it. Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness. He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there. He's still in love with you. How do you figure that's your bunk? He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I? You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her! What?  I improved her a little... Are you okay? I'm  fine. I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel. In West Fork? In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer. No kidding. I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family. So they travel around from place to place and preach? We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry. What about the Captain?  Where's he from? Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath? I think they'll be all right, honey. Why... yes. Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing? I suppose.  It's very expensive. It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas. What are you, an angora wholesaler? No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer. Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that. Two people do.  Orson Welles and me. Wow. You know, you're a very attractive girl. Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady? Yes. My Doctor Lady? Mine, too. Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More... Like this...? I'll cover the back. Stay in the trees. Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories. Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room? The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him. He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular? You'd fuck your uncle! YOU'D fuck your uncle! <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b> <b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b> A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it? Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off. Edie! I  I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows. I don't rate it. Go ahead, wear it. Would you like a drink? Yes, please. What'll it be? Whiskey. He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century. You'd never know it. Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] I'll be right out. T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? Mm. Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him. Mm. Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay? All right. Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you'] Yeah. Fine. Want me to take this for you? But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent. That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts? This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker. Why is that? Are any of them inhabited? Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society. Population? Approximately two hundred thirty million. Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal. I don't believe it! Then why are you afraid to let me prove it? Clarence... Let me handle this. And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah. I'm not FBI anymore. You never were... I asked them to give me a couple minutes... Trying. Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us? Which one of your "bodyguards" is that? Whichever one I want. How's the Ransom account going, Marcus? It's...it's...all right. Really? That's interesting.  Not great? Oh well, you know. And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl. Oh yes. I'm very lucky. Yes, Sergeant? Remember one thing. Sir? Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun. Yes sir! Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you? You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog. This you? Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up. Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll. Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh? This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus. Carmen...? Excuse me...! As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart. But I still want one. Yes -- .... You're home. Yeah. I'm coming over. I'll call you back. No you won't. What do you mean? I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding. Okay.  Yeah, yeah -- 'bye. I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin - That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy - Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" - Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    * Sammy was a con man. A faker. I never said he was faking! I never said that! You exposed him for what he was: a fraud. Fella could get used to a life this ordinary. Maybe you should fuck her mom then. It's bait.  Don't take it. Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging. Did we tape the Duke game? Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday? Nope. She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you. Can you give me some room here? Oh yeah. Sure. Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ... Sure. By shooting at me. Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ... I don't even know your name yet ... My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it. ... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little. Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!? Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans. I need to talk to you. That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp. I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is. Well then. I'd better show you. Terry -- Ha! Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared. I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property. Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores! No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date. Oh, knock it off! _ 89. He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful. Let us wish him peace. You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love. No. It's not that. Do you believe in love? I suppose it's... I mean define your terms. It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something. Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty. This mission was a scam from the word go? Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show. Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left? Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds. No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further. It's the only way. I refuse. You're frightened. No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up. I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere. Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate. Partially... It's the political 'cost of doing business', George. You know when you sat behind me? At the movies? Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her. What would make you think that? I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid. You're not stupid. Just wrong. Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...? Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!? It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan! But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>?? The monkey, of course. It was his idea. Monkeybone...!? Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want. You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>?? Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice! What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong? Just making me feel like a piece of meat. I'm making you feel like meat? Yeah. Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven. It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic... Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted? Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that -- Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots? Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and -- He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on. I don't know about totally. Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange. Do you always transport through the air? I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom... First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787... You know what I mean. Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it? Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once. All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out. That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas? I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us. A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is. Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life. I stand corrected. Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how... What's this? That's my diet shit. This shit was Ming. That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose. I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out... What things do you think you've done? Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back. Scotty, how long is this bay? About 60 feet, Admiral. That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water? I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim? Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno. He had a pressing engagement. Philistine. What is it, honey? It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move. Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is. It's okay, Kanita. Come on in. He looks like a cop. He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates. You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten. He doesn't bite. They never do, Mr. Barker. Baker. Right.  In there. You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls. Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli. You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station. I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you? Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting. Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed? Why...the Rosato Brothers. I know that; but who gave the go ahead. Where did it go? Run. What -- What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets. All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead. You feeling better Franny? Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think. Five ... six. Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count. Well this hasn't happened yet. Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers! Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it? It's a <u>beret</u>... Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will. Lindsey!  Wait a second-- I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars. If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X. Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money. One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars! I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not? We're not after car thieves here. What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick. That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period. Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too? My friend, if you're planning on crossing me... I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out. Shit... Check your read-out. Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now! Take you han's offa me! We got -- I don't know, we got separated Before or after the explosion?  Mueller -- I don't know! And the vampires of the Theatre? Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart. And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie? Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out. It's gotta be right for my customer. Your customer, eh? Yes. Why? I've come to apply for membership in Brolly -- You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man. You know what this is? Yeah, that's why I walked down here. Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks. One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything. You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money! Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago. Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital. Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo? They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together. This has to be a big mistake. The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street. Hold on a sec, I got a call. Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call. I gots to go, it's my Moms. I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice. Oh. thank you. Sure. It s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack. I can t believe it s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?! Page a hundred and twelve. Bye. Bye. Is that who you're waiting for? No... I'm just practicing my lying. Still needs work. You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you. Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something? Yeah, ever since that ... The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there. But is she, has... There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway. There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave. I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities. What are you doing? Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead. Is there anything else I should know about him? Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet. On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners. I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time. You mock my pain! Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago? Putting all that poison in your hair. Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats. Why? Why does everybody conk? Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like -- Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black? I ain't said I'm ashamed. Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you. Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better. Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this. Sorry if I spoke out of turn. Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling? Why don't I? Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play? First oboe. I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party. Absolutely not. Theo. Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter. You must be the new tenants. And you...are? Whose blood is that, Jay? West's. Any kindling for afire? It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches. I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins. No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead. How do you know? Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go. I will give you my house. I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you? Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage. Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president. Oh, you'll still, be guarding him. Drive for a minute. Where you going?! <i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i> <i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i> Where is she? Comin' up the Central Reservoir. Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit. Not great. What's that, not great? The doctor'll be back in a minute. Nona, please. He tore his ACL. There. Where? Can you swim? Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it. Trust me. I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you. You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for? <u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson. Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way. What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down? Borrowed.  I borrowed it. How's it look? I could use a lawnmower... Morning, Mr. Baxter. Morning, Miss Kubelik. Make her easy, John. Watch her. She'll be awright. You wouldn't even see it move. You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it. This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this. You were never thirteen, Mom. Back it down, Johnny! I can go hotter! Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying... Is he cool or angry? Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place. Then, we fight -- Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel? You re not going to get away with this. Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it? Which one of you is what? Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules! Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage -- Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand? Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility. Yours...?! As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help... No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding. Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship. Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis! Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!! What's in this? Nitro-glycerin? Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco? Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing. You have a job? I have several jobs. What do you do? I do different things on different days. Like what? On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport. Helping travelers. Yes. It's really on there tight. Here, let me try. Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation. Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose. Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight? Why? Because I got some plans - I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza - And you'll be in all evening? Yes, Joe. Good!  Then you won't be needing your car. My car?  Why, you - Show business? Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out. By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai? Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got. Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight. What for? For your health. Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next. Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby? Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this. Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive. Yes, there was. Can you tell me what happened? No. I can't. Was anyone hurt? May I have your name please? Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word?? What is it? In private, if you don't mind... Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business. Now just a minute, I  There aren't any cheeseburgers. What? Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ... Listen to me! The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade. You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store. Which ones? All of them. It was after you, baby. After you. Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something? No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it. He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust... Like family, huh? Karen! What the fuck are you doing?! Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry... Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it. This is crazy. Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip. Where do you want it?  In the face? Surprise me. You said you were going to get her out of this. Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him. He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone. I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that-- Three hundred. Fine. What's your name, lover. Edward.  My name is Edward. Edward... you got it! His newspapers? Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks. And if anyone tries to wake me... Damn you, MacReady! She took care of the dealers... Hey, Mitch. ...pit bosses, floor managers. Thank you. But mostly... Cheers Katka! Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris? I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town. I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time. No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure. Andy, who is that guy? I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think. Dick Laurent? Yes, I believe so. But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he? He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead? Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so -- So there are no guests staying on that floor? He's the devil's child... We'll all go crazy... Hi Dad. Hiya yourself. Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project -- Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here. I had to, Edie. I had to see you. Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you. You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you? I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go. Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you. How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other. I don't want to hurt Charley  I don't want to hurt you... It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out. I know what you want me to do! I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do. That    word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... . I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table. I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... . How many times have I fired her? Five-- Six-- Eh. What's going on? You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you... That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago. That just doesn't make any sense. I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one. I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down... You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur! Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya? Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us? She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease. Can he save her? No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research- My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper. Where are you going? Going?  How do you mean? I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off? Drop me off?  How do you mean? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. My fault. You're not hurt, are you? I don't think so. I wish you'd make sure. Why? Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars. Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. Thank you. Who are you? Now, really - We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub. No, I'm fine thanks. Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket. Famous? I've never heard of it. What are you reading? Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic. Show-off. You sure this is your car? My grandmother's rich. Slow down, slow down. Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going. Diane Court. Dude, I can't do it! Why do you look at me like that? I did not know you were so beautiful... and -- And then --? No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever. And -- and -- How tired you are! Yes -- tired... So alone. Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature. You mustn't talk Russian to me. Strange man... Am I quite strange to you? Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer -- And...? He disappeared. Later he was found dead. I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. Go away. Who are you --? A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you. You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me? I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya... Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand. Yes -- I do understand. I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor. I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here? I want to be alone. That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. I want to be alone -- No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me. Just for a minute then. Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss. Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers. I'm gonna hear it tomorrow. You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer. What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them. Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis. There aren't. How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off? It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings. Let's hear it. The milkmaids. The milkmaids? Can we get some coffee...? How ya doing? My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once. What's Early been in jail for? Carryin' a gun. ...Anything else? An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said. Jeez... Adele! H-E-Z-T... Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down. What are you doing out here alone? Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home. Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house? You mad at me? Not mad. Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me. I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you. I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great. Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything. What are you reading? Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic. Show-off. Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would... Finish your breakfast... I gotta catch up with him, Laurie! Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze... But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse. That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records. ...things change. ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro... And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief. I'm sure you would. But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts? My father was a sick man. But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you? You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind. ...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number. Uh-huh. So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet. I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou. Yah? Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR? Oh... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Both of 'em? Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight. ...oh Jesus, what the fuck...? I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing -- Why did you do this? Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these? No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them. Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that? I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ... Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know... Yes Commander? What does the Omega 13 do? Well, that's the big question, isn't it? What do you mean? It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds. But you don't? No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past. How did you come to that conclusion? My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times... Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn. I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully. But what is it they don't like? Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four. What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all? I think it's marvelous. Truly. It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come? I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap? I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that. I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me. Oh no, the honour would be all mine. Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang! Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio! Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool. What? Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you. I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water. What's the difference? Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession. The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog? Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in  share.  People do that. He was disoriented in transport, Tron. Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country? Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it. Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they? You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically. Then all you have to do is untrigger it. Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine. Where's Hunt now? In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me. And? He wants money. Pay him. Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ... What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him. Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages. Done. Thanks, but no thanks. Against your code? I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come? Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder? No. Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them? That's right. Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling. Why were Lefferts' eyes black? I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan. You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? Wait.  Our deal still holds? Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what. I'll go for that. It was very well hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late. It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying. Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful. The spiral begins in the west. Where the spiral begins. Morgue...? That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us. They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard. Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status? Where is it? Is that what I think it is? I thought you said the eggs weren't... It's fine. Mind your own meal... You should get the order you want. And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that? I didn't think there was an alarm. Take him to the car, Bob. ...About five years now. Get the fuck outta here. Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other... You're a government spook? Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu... Excuse me, we need to make a call. I'm on the phone. It's important. So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying? Listen, man, we really gotta... I be off in a minute.  Say again...? It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses. You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit - It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it. I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades - Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is? Oh, how inappropriate is that! Take a whiff of heaven. How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties? I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother-- Give me those! And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack! Would you please go and look? In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly... Better believe it. Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive. What happened to you, then? How'd you find me? Burlesque"? Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him. He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens. I shoulda sent you instead of Jack. I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader. You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit. Like hell. You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away. I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt. You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball. You been in the Majors? Yep. Can't talk right now. See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail. Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules! Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage -- Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand? Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility. Yours...?! As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help... No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding. Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship. Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis! Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!! Richard, shut it and keep it down. If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game. She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her. Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them. I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out. Okay, but you're missing all the fun. Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them. Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does? It's almost over!! No. It's not. Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you re okay? Well, I m just a little confused right now about why I work here... You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son. I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist? Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her. You wanna talk to her alone? Yeah. What would your girlfriend think of that? I don't have a girlfriend. My point exactly. I'm serious here. So am I. C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently. You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building? You know what I'm saying here. Where's Irth? Sandy, scan the whole sky. Then you'll be going to school here....? School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I? I'm terrified. Come here. I... Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up... I... We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>. I'm very sorry I... You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him? You!  Are you the mother of that child? No.  I mean yes. Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is! Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble! I don't like him. You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta? There's something pathetic parked in front of my house. Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it. I'm still waiting for the mortgage check. I mailed it to you on Wednesday. Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here. Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office. MOTHERFUCKER!! COCKSUCKER! From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds. What would you do up here? Look. Talk. Not talk. Thank you very much. How much will it...? On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor. Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach? I didn't grovel, I asked him to help. What did you pay him? Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food! I can look after myself! They were taking you away. It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business? You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad. That's also my business. Can they be killed? These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced. Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of... We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have. Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El. Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle? Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning. Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle? HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess. Looks like the best man won. What do you mean, they take out her butt? Oh, Jesus H. Christ! Are we on "Cops" again? You could be quiet. Hi. Hi. It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em. Oh, naw. Hi. This here's Loretta. I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer? Just now. Guess who? Did you know that I'm giving up teaching? Really? Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody. That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about? Show me again. Annie! One more time. Were you in Nam? Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit. I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on. But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why? It's a Carpet Cleaning Company... A Carpet Cleaning Company? No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned. You... you left them a message? I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys... You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman. No. Or her name? No. Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game. Same here. You can retire my number. I flinched. Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt. That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time. Now you know. Mission control to Chuck, come in... You're late. Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! Lily! Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away. I have. Or there would be twice as many. But you're the fairest by far. You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why? I understand. I'm so sorry You can stay tonight. I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone. Good night. Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and-- What about everything since? Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around. Lighten up... That's mine. Have done, and you lot get your pens out. I had everything. Once. So what happened? Life knocked me back. I came into this world flat on my ass. And now you have everything. No. Not everything. Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes. I guess I am. Just a little. What do you mean? Scared. You did great, Bones... Just great. Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us. Response? Nothing. As before. What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban. Aye, sir. It smelled of the fire. It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way. Really? Tell me about it. It's an uprising. Of birds? Certainly, of birds. Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo? He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello. I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie. I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em. You've got your own TV show? The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream. I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody. Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something. You did not like the speech? The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible. Oh my God. What's wrong? Frank!!! Does it hurt? Haven't you got a bullet I can bite? Stop. Goosed! Give me the Valium. Can we use our indoor voice please... I'm flying blind here God damn it! Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office? No -- only occasional jobs. Tired? You pay me. You're a very unusual stenographer -- Moreover... Moreover... Is this all we got left? If that's all you got, that's all we got left. I'm happy too and we want you to be happy. I'm so happy I could shit. CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word! And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs. What kind of weight? You been drinkin', huh? Few beers is all. Feelin' any better? What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way. He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming? It's kind of late. It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof. Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast. I didn't get it, did I? No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out. Nothing. Is there a mutual feeling between you two? No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him? Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit. What do you mean? Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded. I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him. From who? I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy. What? While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am. Yeah? What three words, Harry? Pick 'n' Save. Hm? You heard me, Pick 'n' Save. I thought you were over it. I am. Well, maybe not completely-- You mean -- worried about my testimony? No -- worried about you.  Personally. I can call them... I can call my dad. But you won't. Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway. Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound. That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought. Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French. Shit is a French word? Casey.  She's my only friend. What about me? It's Will Graham... Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and.... Where did you get it?! Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons? Yes, they were. I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me. Oh, I wasn't worried about that. No? I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band. I'd like to go, sir. No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid. My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him. I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters. Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully? Why?  You think he might tell you where I am? Unless you wanna tell me. He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me. One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island. I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island. Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island? I just thought maybe you and me could-- What's this tiger shit? No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him. You think? I wasn't looking.. I was running. But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner? He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna... Was it Pascow? Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to-- Don't bother. I'm coming home. What do you want me to do? Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him. I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin. What is, Red, the intention or the act? I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up. Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action. What's the point of this? Does everything have to have a point? It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look. Oh, for God's sake, Will. Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun. I told you to cooperate with these people. C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work. But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection. C-connection? I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now! Telling you what? Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection! Smack? Goddammit, where are you from, Mars? Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it! Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin! Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive! Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive. Wait... just wait. It was him. You can't go in there. Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation. Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise. Exactly as the simulations predicted... Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels... Your scanners must be malfunctioning. All ship functions are off-line. I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven. Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed. Bullshit. He's a liar. News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat. You think you're so god damned smart, don't you? Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase? What?  Yeah, sure. Whose cloths?  Your clothes? My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter? I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important. What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes. I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know. It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos. The coca is my responsibility! You're a fucking amateur! The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep. Good luck. They lied. They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is? I do. Yes. You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago. That's not my handwriting. You've just said you signed it. Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure. You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years? Because I kept a copy. I have it right here. Here you are, Sugar. A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along? You betcha. City hall? You must not remember anything. Come on. Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit? Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed. See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though. You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him? Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring. The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that. Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest. Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it. Well, that certainly won't do. What do you mean -- ? Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ... You got no choice. It's over. Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ... Yeah? Paulie, you've got kids, right? He's gone. Uh-huh. I gotta go get a haircut. Uh-huh. This has got to stop! He escaped.  He's going back in. Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter? There are no windows facing my...exposure. George, this is the third time. The plumber's due out on Friday. You'll have to explain that to the police. You were the only neighbor I could tolerate. I did warn you. My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what. First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense. Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season. It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer. Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up. She sings, too. I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away. And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something... Get on this, right now... ...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is... ...this's <u>good</u>... Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says... Is she saying this in Albanian...? <u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional... No, sir. How about Miss Flintstone? No, sir. Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead? Is that him? Is that him? Yes. How do you know my name? It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt. And what is your name? Phoebe. Phoebe? I call myself Phoebe. Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own? Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare. Prepare what? My disguise.  And here... Do I have to talk to those two? My boss and your boss.  Sure. Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath? I was hoping for a kind word, little sister. You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me! I have! Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars. Where're the others? I'm through! We're through! Yes! Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing. Is THAT Odin? You'll have to wait till he's finished his game. Odin! Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that! Shut up! All of you! Mr. Millaney? Yeah. Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office. Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client. He said immediately. All right, jesus. I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now? I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure. Tommy, let's put the tape on. Now? Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing. Fuck, OK. All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan. I'm calling the police. So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that? Hi. Hi. Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is. MMMmmmmmm. Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together? When's your deadline? Monday. Push it. What? Forget it. It's a smear campaign, Charlie. It's drawn from a selectively circulated... Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book. Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented. And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face? I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so. Shall I give you a few ideas? Please. Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school -- For pay? For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school -- I'm as underprivileged as they are -- Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense? I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative... That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag? I beg your pardon? I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working. Excuse me? My wedding tackle. I'm sorry? My meat and two veg. Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest. Have you ever made love to a Chigro? A Chigro? You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro. We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive. That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews! Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it. That's because I don't have a doorbell. Yes what? Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion. What question? Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself -- The 'question' -- Yes, Bill.  The question. That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it? Yes, but I lent it... And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they? Yes... but... I didn't... Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle? No...  I don't have room in my kitchen... Don't feed that dog. You people really don't like dogs. Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied. If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy... And Jos , my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...? What is that? What does it look like?  It's an address book! Harry, we spoke with Martin. We? Chili and me. Let's meet tonight, okay? Where? Cafe Blase. Thank you. I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this? You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me. So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that? I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this? It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art. Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent? I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like... This shocking image of repressed femininity! Right, exactly! I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret! Who cares? Chicks are for fags. I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means. Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some". Some what? You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it. Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to. Sure I do. On one condition. You can't marry my mom. It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision. Shut up! Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate. Michael. Yeah? You want to come here a minute? Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem. Really? Who's your P.O.? Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up. Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way. You like them, don't you, Boss. Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning. Who are you?  The undertaker? Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out? Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help. You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock. I can't stop thinking about you. Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill. What old mill? Is that somewhere we -- I just wanted to say that. Come by my house. Laura, do you love me? Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter. Why? It does. No, it doesn't... just kiss me. It does matter. We're in love. James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn. You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth. Gobble, gobble, gobble. Great. You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go? Well, you know... I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? Ugh ... It never rains but when it pours -- As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds. What's all this for, more security? I fitted a lock up there. On the inside. Oh, that'll come in useful. Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it? Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself! But can there be a society composed of just two ants? No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants! Look around, sweetheart. Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine. How about dog shit? Sorry.  We were saying? You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry? Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me. You mustn't be afraid. But she's dead! Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing. Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible. But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead. Is that so? Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively. You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days? Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me. What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?! They shot him in his library. I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny? Nobody.  At least not yet. And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me? Gone.  Not a trace. Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper! It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken. Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money. This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all... Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this. I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job. Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ... That's right. What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I? How'd you know it was me? Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint. How goes the roll call? We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for. You mind? I'm eating, huh? Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you? I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it. Used you? I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand. War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me. I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay? The peace conference. What peace conference? Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again... Who are they? I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex. Is he alright?  What happened? The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with? There it is! Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again. That one. Nah.  Hates his wife. Yes, I see it! I see it! Ya-hoo, let's'play ball! Go ahead, say it. No.  I got lucky with the lights. No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max. NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT! Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett. Jerk... What did you say? I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it. It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports. No.  I mean it, thank you. Nothing's going to happen. Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan. I'm not playin' myself no mo'. How you sound? I won't do it anymore. Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional. I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing. No costume.  No blackface. Knight ... Black... ... death ... Love... ... death ... Dinner?  Absolutely. Absolutely. Show us the manager. He wears a suit. They have him in the lobby, go quickly. You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face. Thank you. Ray, maybe this isn't ... No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer. Marcia's living with a singer? Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met. Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters. Ugh. They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood. If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me. Miz Cooper! What? The man! The man! Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a-- Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle! Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee. Little rum in yours, too? I guess so. Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'. Yeah, gal I been here before. I guess you have. My God... Should I raise shields? Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register? Yes. I tested positive. Yes. Welcome to hard times, Daddy. I used to live in this house. But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night. They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man. You gave them me. I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along. We're sure it's hers? Has her books in it. How you doin'? I'm all right. You ever done time before? You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core. Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg. Preciate it. Claude. I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder. Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne. Would this be easier for you in the dark? Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this. You what? This is all terribly wrong. Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable? Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly -- Are you afraid of me? No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie. Benjamin, is this your first time? Is this -- what? It is, isn't it? It is your first time. That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha. You can admit that, can't you? Are you kidding? It's nothing to be ashamed of -- Wait a minute! On your first time -- Who said it was my first time? That you're afraid -- Wait a minute. -- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way -- INADEQUATE! Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare.. Leeloo.. You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him? Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell. I suppose so.  Yes. And charming? I've never given it much thought. Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness. I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play. New York City? First class. The Plaza Hotel? A little Mu-shu. Some Kung-Pao? What? Nothing.  So good luck. Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him. Yeah? Maybe you can be his stand-in. Get <u>away</u> you little monster. I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush! I don't believe in statistics. You're an accountant for cryin' out loud. Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K. This is absolute nonsense! Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy? Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad. It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts. And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him? Not yet. I'll be forced to tickle you. Oh my God. What? I wonder where they went. Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note. It's an idea. Beth -- To be on the safe side.  I mean -- You want to kill him? Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place. What time was it? Huh? What time did Matt Brown get in? Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after  I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in? That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . . Was it twelve o'clock? Commander' Decker? Our Exec and Science Officer... A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going? That's none of your business. You're on a budget from now on. You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck. No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him. Well that's a ... long story ... Well, I could ... free up some time... I'm listed. I'm tempted. This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for? Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting? I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place. Reed's gonna fix me up -- For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical. Skeptical...? Too demure? I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence. Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming... What did security say? They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing. Well, you got another problem. The replicators? Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab. This day just keeps going from bad to worse. Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick. Hello Ugarte. A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you re hungry. Thank you. But I think I ll go to bed. It s been a long day. Right... Well, I ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then. Yeah. Goodnight, Emily. Don t fall asleep with your hair wet. Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet? What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet. All right. What happened to our bracelet? Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it. What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks. No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time. Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go! Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer. My God, an actual operating 8-track. What, you've never seen one before? In the Field Museum once. It works. It worked when you were in sixth grade. Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er -- Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky. Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there. How'd you get the job? Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy. Yes. I don t think I can...control myself. I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go? Isn't this a fabulous picture? Yes. She's such a great photographer. Hm. So where should I put it? I thought it was okay where it was. It's much more personal in here. A notch above the storage room. We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she? The both of you. But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius. So how much do you hate her? Big time. You take care of your family? Sure. You know where they are? Sure. How far? About ten kilometers. Sixty Lira? Sixty? I don't know where he is. Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak. Go away, or I'll call the police. Why you want to do that, to a frien'? I haven't changed anything.  Damn. I... I've got to take a piss. If I told you once...I told you a thousand times... I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried... Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you? Yes. So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?! Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got. Sloan and I have been looking all over for you. You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short? No offense. Manray needs a job. Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach. How very. Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids. Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life. Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them. Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this. The princess is dead. Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now. Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it. Aye.  Black Baron's mischief. If the horn be restored the curse is ended. Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack? I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake! Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough. Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start? I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter. Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben. Does Jackie know this? No.  I'm doing it behind her back. In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she? Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three... Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer. Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out. Not if I kill you first ... I'll be in touch. No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do. Can you see it? No. What does that mean? Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty. Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off. Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class. You're kidding. Would you like me to change anything? So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account? We'd have no way of knowing that, sir. Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me? Patrick? Yes? Nothing. Ready Lloyd? Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started. My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that. And whose houses do you design...? Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands... You still feel that crazy...? Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here. Yes, Mr. Brett--right away. After dinner you paid him to have sex with you. Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know. ...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man... I don't understand. She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind. That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought... She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri. I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create -- Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them. I've come to apply for membership in Brolly -- You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man. Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that... Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott? We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral... See that it is.  Take me over, please. You sure have to hand it to those guys. What do you mean? I mean pulling a stunt like that. What are you talking about? Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate? They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark. Engineering... How do you feel? Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth. Life is true. Life is real. Roy -- Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey! What was that?? Hostage negotiations. Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry. Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time. No problem.  Sorry. You bet. Bill Styles... Who? Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone? Check it out. Not for the faint of heart. Pharmaceutical! You are a god. One for you and one for me. Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed. Now that's more of what we're looking for. BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life! Don't get all sappy about it! Back, Kelly.  Lean back! Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit. Where's Shorty? I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back. Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise. I see. I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious. Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces. There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you... I'm only looking out for you. And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke. Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise. What? Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir. Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise. Sir? You having hearing problems, mister? No, sir. Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp. Is there quicksand? Ayuh. Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was? Healy. How was she? Fabulous. Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers? Are you alright? Just a little queasy... Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship. Right. And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant. I'll keep that in mind. Is it the frank or the beans? I think a little of both. Well if you could tell me roughly it would help. Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation? Yeah.  Great. I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here. No problem.  If I can ask one question. Fine.  One. It sounds stupid. Nevermind. You won't like it. Just ask it! Is it better? Is what better?  Better than what? Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better? Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you? Of course it is. You really think it would make a difference either way? I don't know. Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet. Never? I haven't felt like it. But not even before, when he was living upstairs? No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better. The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet. Will you please just go? I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along? Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky. So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake. I'm fine. Ok... I'm in Detroit. I know. At a gas station.  Will you marry me? Yes. Did you hear what I said? Yes I did. Did you hear my answer? I think so. Can you catch a plane? Yes. Did you eat? I love you. Oh, please, don't hurt me. I just need to use the phone, lady. Oh, let me get out of your way then. What happened?  Did you lose your keys? Have a nice day. But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is! Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't... You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now? No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry. Ooop, excuse me. How you doin', brother? I don't really know where we are. The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links. I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career. You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over... I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk. I don't like it, George... Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed? It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed... We don't know what else to do. We need results. You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay. I'm gonna be here if you need anything. David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request... I don't understand. I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy. Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor. What? As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation. The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here! The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- ! Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime -- -- alleged crime -- -- in a context. Not a star-jumper. Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right? A king must marry, after all. ...of course... What's so funny? We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital. You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them. I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life. You didn't have to kill Sophie. Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy. I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work. I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from. You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority? You can't mean that. Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something. I don't have to ask if you can feel that. Goddamn it. I want Louis. I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh? It's not what you think, Jake. No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it! Wait a minute.  Just listen to me... ...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000... Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene. You celebrate, Jerome? To be quite honest it turns my stomach. Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution. You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ... Do the books!  Do the books! Yes, sir.  Thank you. Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there. Okay... On what? How about the pig-lizard? Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard. I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house. That's it then. I don't want to stay here... Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman... What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'? Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday. It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media. You like baseball? Oo! Darling! Something is the matter. You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast. Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away! What, darling? Thursday. Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right. Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel! Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there. Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time. I thought that was part of the charm! I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much. A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing? I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears. I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill? No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later. And if the police stop by - what do I tell them? Tell them we're working for the University. Thought of everything haven't you. Yep, except a name for this place. You're nuts man, Katka's right! A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours? Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me. You don't have to be embarrassed. I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it. It's ok if you are. A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked-- Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this-- I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--! Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that? Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid? <u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left. Who's this fat man, then? Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry. I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this? Excuse me? Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny? Yes. I don't and I don't think you should... Want the wagon unloaded, Clay? Just the grub box and bed rolls. We can't talk inside either? Electronic surveillance. We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey. I'm listening. Caesar's Mafia, isn't he? You have to ask? No. Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business. How did you meet him? They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it. He's a launderer? Basically. How long have you been with him? Almost five years. Five years is a long time. Yes, it is. Stay up there, Girl... Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head... Yoooooow. Don't look down! Eight thirty. AM or PM? Pro, the sun's out! Oh, right, right... Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time. You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour. Where are you going? I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow. What if it's not who you think it is? If he crosses the bridge, it is. There must be another way! I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone. Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this. There's no choice. Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you. What am I going to do with you? Don't be cruel to a heart that's true. Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier. But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true? Your vision? Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side. You are mad! Am I? We'll see.  What's going on, colonel? Here's what I want you to do. Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation? I don't notice anyone else complaining. I didn't shoot West... What? Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body. Do you think George is a fairy? Who? That kid... the hairdresser. Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser. Trip?? She left me. Crabs. Left you...? Who? Emily? This morning. I found a note in the kitchen. But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here? What's she waiting for? Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her. By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared? I work here, sir. I m here most of the time. You wouldn t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you? You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait? No. Thank you. I ll be fine... Destroy all that which is evil... ...so that which is good may flourish I don't know what the hell to say.... You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel.... What? The door security systems are shutting down. Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he? I know just where to go. Not the drugstore! Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me. The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it? Nine-thirty, ten maybe. Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay? Kiss the back of my knees. Through the sweats or not? Not. Mn-hm. Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think? So you do fantasize? Yes. About who? I fantasized about you. About me? Yes. Where are we going? We're getting out of this place. We've done enough. Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent? It doesn't matter anymore, forget it. Of course it matters. Hey, hold on! What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me. Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that. No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander? We can't leave now. We have to do something. Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said. I ain't no more a preacher, you know. We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words. I'll say 'em--an' make it short.  This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "All that lives is holy." But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it. You did good... What? Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside... There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit... Still...you did the right thing. Did you hear? Yes, the child ... You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin? What's that? A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together. Feeling a bit blue, are we? Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it? Okay. You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa- I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE! Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it? I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced... Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss... Everybody loves trout. I'm serious. What're we going to do?! Where're we going?! The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left! How? Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along -- I don't think I want to hear this -- Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right. THAT'S why you built this ship? It's ... incredible. You were... very... inspiring. A script!  I thought we just walked through everything... Read it.  It'll be fine. And I really don't know your noises yet. Well, when you wonder, ask me. Okay... I will... Humped Yes. I can think of worse ways to go-- I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine. Stand up. I said I'm fine. You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty. No, that's really unneces -- --and certain chemicals involving proteins -- You left something out. What's that? The Breath of God... Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime... What are you gonna talk about? Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual... Then why are you putting on mascara? I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up. But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates... Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara... Or blush.  You look pale. What's that? A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything. Please come, please. W... I can't wait for you to meet her! Thanks, doll. I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn. Why is everybody giving me crap tonight? Assholes. This happen to you? Twice a year. Brian? Hi, Helen. Man, you look great. You look like... Brian. Majesty! Did we vote in the end for German or Italian? That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign... Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady. Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead... Don't get too far! Hurry up! What? I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams. Let's do it. Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed. You got it, sir. What happened to your house? Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee. Finder's fee? He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it. It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does? Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat. I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room. It seems fine. You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here. Does that include the key to the laboratory? What's wrong, Available? Please... No. Will you pardon me? <U>Gladly</U>. Hello, John. Hello. How much sleep do you need? How much sleep? How long can you go without sleep? That depends. Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door. Hello? Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you. I don't do favors for you anymore. It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with. They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights. I loathe bats. So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most. Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip. We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves. They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training. Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month. That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case. I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business. That will mean another interview, won't it? No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies. The West Indies? A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know. But it's so far away... That's rather nice, isn't it? He's better, isn't he? Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know. I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice. You look so different. I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders. I think it looks good. I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom. How is she? Sleeping. I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could. You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you. The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness. Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes. Bill. Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed. It's you I want to talk to, Bill. Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office Yeah, I guess you do. You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison. Frank, I don't want to hear it. Senator Long set your boss up, my friend. Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing? What? At the mercy of a mad pilot. We'd be eternally grateful if you  I'm still here. But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else -- As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem? I'm afraid it's the "van" again. The van? Is it your vehicle? No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat. Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood. My God, you've got one? I will when you're finished writing it. What are these? Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free. I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something. Macaulay. That's it...  Herbert Macaulay. tried him once - Why don't you try him again? Ted. Not now, Elaine! Ted! Which one is me? The horse? Get out of here. Move it! You keep that key handy. Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks? No. You can have them. God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it. Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that. Crawfords. Whatever. From Starfleet? Who else? Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please! You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances? Great Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron? That's why I'm crying. Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is? I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay? Okay... Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night. Okay. Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire. How's this about me? They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture. Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations. Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you? You're crazy. I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can. How's it going for you two? Not well. Rejected? Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems? None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA. This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor! The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type. But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62? I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important. I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky. Be careful, dude. Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb? This is the last time I come to this place. Excuse me? Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired. We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away. Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive. -- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one. Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been -- Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy? Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here. What's wrong? Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ... Yeah ... But you didn't come so I kept on wiping. He wouldn't kill anybody... Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West -- I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him! Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping. And? No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate. Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got... Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter. Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag. Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's! Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it. George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it? One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else. Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now. I'm just saying -- I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can. Let's not even talk about it. It was stupid. Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One? When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember? That's alright, we got a pressing engagement! Yeah, right outside the door! You've been to his quarters, haven't you? Once or twice. I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth. He's a writer, not a madman. Then what's he doing here? Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about? Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around. Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor? No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court. Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars. What are you talking about? He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off. Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally? So we should "wait and see." For how long? I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him. Fine. That's all there is to it then. No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do. Okay, okay--I know you do, too. It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it? Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you. What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble. Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise... I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready? No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck. You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie? That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves. So what, you left her there. I shot her. Your brother told us. Daddy.... Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go. You're not? No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you. Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage. Don't bother! What? Don't bother. I'll be right back. Now this is war. Roger that. You'll never guess what's happened!! What?? John has fallen in love with me! That idiot boarder? Hello, Brigman. Hello, Mrs. Brigman. Is Mr. Fazeli in please? Who wants to know?  Zeus! I'm a bowler. I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be? That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary. Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married. It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage. You don't know anything about me! I know enough. This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game. Very impressive. Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us. Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too. God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker. Somebody has to help you lazy bastards. You are despicable. I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square. And I might have something important to tell you... What is it, a surprise? That's right... Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves? He'll live. We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island. Maybe he's going to drug her? We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back. They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now! You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep. These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them - No, sir. Excuse me. What did you say? I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner. It's not an easy thing to meet your maker. And what can he do for you? Can the maker repair what he makes? Would you like to be modified? Had in mind something a little more radical. What's the problem? Death. I'm afraid that's a little out of my... Hey, hey, where you goin'? Home. What are you crazy? Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!! I can't... they don't operate that way... Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary. Dr. Gruber. Dr. Gruber's not in. I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting... He's not in, Sir. Where is he? Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see? Yes. Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see? Yes. Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see? Oh, God. Do you see? Please, no. No' what? Not me. Are you a man? Yes. Do you imply that I'm a queer? God, no. Are you queer, Mr. Lounds? No. I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers. Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms? Athos, please...! Get out of my way. Athos, I beg you -- Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case. The check wasn't cashed? I just called downtown, and it's on their desk. You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions. You mean about that gun? That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that. Damn, I wish this thing would go faster. Relax.  We're almost there. We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left! Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! Them? Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going. Tell me about Lina Moebius. How did you...? I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants. You mean the <i>Times</i> guy? Which <i>Times</i> guy? With the shoes... There was more than one? What'd you fight, middleweight? Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam? Flyweight. You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl. You're not my type. Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants. Just a minute. Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now   the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all. Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation? Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong. What went wrong? Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism. Yes? Who is there? It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please. Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you. Good gracious!  What is this? You are going to drive to the frontier. It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house. I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not. Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand. Your honor must lower his voice. All Europe shall hear of this! As you please. I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy. Then don't. Are you the proprietor? And who might you be, sir? Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it. I don't think so. No sir, we're closed. What did he say? What did he say? Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room. Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that. He just gave me his "monster" speech. That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. Get out. We have nothing to talk about. Rae, I need help. Why come to me? Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him. What's stopping you? They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through. What makes you think I could? Why would they stop you? Because I'm your sister. You wouldn't like Razinin. He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia! He's engaged the override. Can you shut it down? So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's? Three years.  Sister. Three years.  A rookie. A novice. Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows? I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece. M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself. Now what is up with that? The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA. Cool. What'd it do to you guys? Easterners. We're just fine, thank you, sir. ... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like. Shurrup, cheerful. What is wrong with you? I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this. You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people. Really? No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float. Okay. Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'. He flies as well, then . . . Constantly. He has powers as we do . . . Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice. We will bring him to his knees! Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city. So, how was the ride, kids? Great. Really? Do you know what time it is? Uum... around ten? This way. Oh, man! Wait a second? Who was working here today? Just me. I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral. We did. Then who operated the store? Nobody. It was closed. With this guy locked in? Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there. No way to take another day or two? No. You'll see when we get inside. What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed! No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her. You're lying! I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen... That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect! I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this. My god. There's more. Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back. You got a live arm there. Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil. Good or evil, what's the difference? I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem-- Can't do it. May I help you, madam ... Mr. John Steed, please. I'm afraid that's impossible. Impossible? So what do you think? Sign me up. You get massage from Chinese girl before? No.  It's my first time. You pick any girl for you and your friend. Who was that? Grayson - Anne's lawyer. What did he want? Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act. Yeah... I know the routine. You are married? Was.  Divorced. We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us. It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place. We're going to have to explain away the... They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than... Ah, Cats. Now and Forever. Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen. How did it happen? The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help? How many are, down there? The whales...?! No power to the bay doors. The explosive override -- ? It's under water! There's no way to reach it... Go on ahead... Close the hatch! Admiral, you'll be trapped! You expecting someone? No. Ignore it. To the limit. You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind? Like...? Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials? No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances? No. Good.  So let's go... We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in? Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn... We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it. All right then, we'll use your plan. What you doin', son? It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her. This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him. Clown?  Now back up there, buddy... You said he washed the money? Yeah. Then what?  Exactly. He hung it up. What? To let it dry. Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank. Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub? Yeah? I want you to come. HARRY! MS. HELLER said not to talk to you. That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam. A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake. You did? Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin. Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate... Oh, you want to talk about your delicates? Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special. You and Lloyd chose the class!? Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz. Papers--they all want me to sign papers. Dr. Meirschultz, too? I'm in, too. Cleo! Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family. OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here. OK. I don't wanna lift crates. You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place. My God, what the hell are you...? Hurry, the woman needs help! I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look? Good. Thanks. Sup. Sup. Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves. I'm gonna fuck you up bitch. Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman. And where do you find the models? Oh, there are as many as one wants. I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia? You're still here? I came back. I thought that's what you wanted. Bye.  Thanks. Remember, get the seat fixed. Uh-oh... ... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher... Jesus... If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight. Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send -- You know how to get back to the Windmill, right? Got it. I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did. Good. So did I. Okay. See you around. Um... did you still want to read my novel? Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course. Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK. That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore. Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out. I only did it once and... You really think I'm attractive? For a butt-head? Yes. I'm going out there. Hey -- you can't do that. Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life -- So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun -- Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door. No. I said Dunbar. Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie. Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge. Locate. Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter! On screen. I'm tired of this game. Please play without me. But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty. He's gone? Yeah - it's all right... let's go. It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La. Who and what is Shangri-La? You? Goodness, no! So there are others? Oh, yes. Who, for instance? In time you will meet them all. We found him this morning. What's that next to him? His head.  Someone cut it off. Ellen. You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor. He hates me. Lucien Baines? You get a call from Rose? This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now. Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days. My boss. You're not working at Random House, I talked to them. You WHAT? You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco. Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what? She seems very nice. Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk - Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married? Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help. We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us. Can't he? He's done it, son! Who'd you call? No one. I didn't have the number. Now I think we really do understand one another. Right... Right. And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was - Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home. Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry. I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see. Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here. Done! Ready! Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons. The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow. Can you configure it? I believe so. Do it. Can I have a glass of water? Certainly - how about some breakfast? Possibly some coffee? Moffo! I'm off. I need to sleep. Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you. The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway. No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling? I feel good. No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh? Nope. Where are we running, Joe? As far away as possible. That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us - Cold? Frozen. Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now. He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes. Who? Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should. You find something objectionable to working in partnership with.... Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous... You were given backup.... THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint... I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that. And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but... No, I don't get you... Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't... Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint... I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement... Jesse, we got to have a word. Sure, cousin. All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang. Yep. Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here. Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount... Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back. Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help? It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him. How? He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him. I don't understand. I still don't either, even after all these years. Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated. I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose? Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks. It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you. Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind. It's not enough. What? Her... I swear that that woman in my room... I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it. That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan. These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer. I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry. It's okay, Stanley. It's alright. There are things about love-- --Nothing! Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon. She was playing with my Pooh doll again... What the hell is going on? Maybe it's an air raid. Right. And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard... Yeah. He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard. Give me the keys. You're not going to drive. Give me the keys! You're not going to drive! It's my goddamn car! It's our goddamn car! Give me the keys. No. This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me. Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130. Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that -- I understand, Dick. Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing? There isn't time. Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk. Another distraction.  It's not right. Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game? Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate. I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left. All right. Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game. Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready. Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan. Football is my life. You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning. You think you're so...but you're just... That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it. Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker. Used to be my partner. ...I m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that s who I am. Do you get what I m fucking saying, Mr Lombard? What about your friendly cop? My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But he s a good guy. He ll listen to you. He won t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay? They're hungry. I got it. When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning? You've heard this story before? So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me. What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days? Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you. Mornin', Jabez ... Hello, Stevens ... you're early today. Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone. Some other time, Stevens. You... gonna take... the money? You better get on back, Miss. Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me. I don't understand. I've always known... I'll die alone. I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know. Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you? Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin. Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill. It's okay, Mom.  Trust me. Well, get me and Chris a drink then. I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature. But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it. How about you Brutus? Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want. Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene? I'll take a ride. Go for it. Come on. Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again? Yes, Monsieur. A champagne cocktail, please. Yeah.  Lenny.  I have. It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them... I guess. And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it? No.  It didn't. So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again? Fine, Bob. How are you? Never better. Really? Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away. Not tonight. What's the matter? I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing. We have some nice places around Vancouver. I'm sure you have. Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there. I haven't been invited. Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go. Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash. Nobody I'd rather have on a leash. We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one. This is big enough. It's never big enough. You...made that? I said I did, didn't I! I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories. Got a beer? Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people. He likes you well enough to stick around. Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since. Whadaya mean? It's from an IRA. Oh shit... No wallet, huh? No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil? What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right? How is this, sir? Perfect! Perfect! I wish you luck, sir. Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is. Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch! Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity, What'd you come back for, babe? Just had to be sure. I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now. Better than starving to death. I can't hear him. Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....? Stress category. Correct.  Origin? Birth born....UMMM...Sexact. Violation? We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. Admittance form is wrong. Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... ...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water... They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? No. Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up. Right. Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan. Right. Brindisi versus Electric Boat. You got a good memory, Franky. I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport... Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you. No! Don't --  Oh, wow. What? Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after? Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble. Thank goodness.  Breaktime. Kat, wait. I don t want you hating me. We ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this. Um, news flash: I don t give a shit. Kat, stop it. You do. You can t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up. Stay. Teach me to be compassionate. I'm going home to my machine. Let me out of her!  Right now! Answer the question-- Where to -- ? Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go -- Parker. Sir? What is that? What, sir? You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady. That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury? Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night? Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself. Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen -- You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never. I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual. Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet. Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this? Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing. Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure. Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah. For God's sake, when does this end?! What's that? You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language. Why else would they be willing to put you under... ? Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich. They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough. Do you think? Maybe we should call someone -- The phone's out. Yeah. Well, we can just -- Ben, I don't think he wants us here. GUARD! GUARD! Alamo... GUARD!!! You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s. A "t. a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word. It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking! Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you... Jesus Christ -- YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?! You saved my life. Did you think I could just leave you...? When'd you get to town, Raines? The other day.... What for? No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ... Where you been, anyway? Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ... You seem a little hinked-up ... Not at all ... Yay! Hurray! Where do we go from here? To a hard night's work, son. Come on! That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either. What happened to you? I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt. Hi, Sweetie. Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters. Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already. Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away! Don't act so -- crazy. I'm sorry. Let's go. That's a good girl. Around here.  Yeah. If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source. What do you want? I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts. Like a union? Like a club. Work less, make more. Thank you, no. We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor. And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me.... Don't look! Turn around. Is it bad? Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready? For what? Maddy's party. I don't feel very festive. You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares. Oh, what is this shit? Keep driving. Don't slow down. Christ... Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will. You want to see a violation? This is a violation... Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig. Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them. I've caused you some trouble. Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it. You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite. What'd she say? You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back. Does she know people are trying to kill me out there? She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival. So what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go. We have nothing to talk about, Lenny. Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car. This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon. Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth. Thank you, Captain. Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets? But all ends well. How does it? I don't know. It's a mystery Hello? It's Charlotte. Charlotte, who? Thanks for getting me back in one piece. Thanks, but no thanks. Against your code? I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come? Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder? No. Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them? That's right. Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling. Why were Lefferts' eyes black? I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan. You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? Wait.  Our deal still holds? We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home. That would be much appreciated. Thanks. Well? In Vienna... I can't do that,  It's a Rolex. A what? Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace. You love her, but you hate her? No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want? It's...42 56 76 . 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast. Doug, I can't just leave you! You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay. I don't like this, this... Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor. Hey, maybe she knows where this is? That seems likely. It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything-- It's crucifying him--! Anything *better* to offer? Maybe he won't get up. But--if he *does*, Joe-- Ufa! I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed. Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me. We're cool. Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him. Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me. How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you? They're fine. Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you. No, no, don't talk to Immigration! Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me? You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. I have? Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra. Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer. Epps? You there? Right here. Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined! It don't matter! What's that you say, Son? I say -- it don't matter. Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out. Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain! Which one is me? The horse? Get out of here. Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets. Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation! Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events? We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race! Do you have the right to murder? What are you doing here? I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel. Oh, yeah? He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings. Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax? Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun. Now, why in the hell would you assume that? I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun. Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people. Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know? Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important. Whatever you need, I'll be there. Right on Brother Judge... Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it? Do you know? No. You don't? No. What is happening? Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you. Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you. Then don't talk about killing. Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die. Don't say that. It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. OK. Think we can fit up in there? Only one way to find out. I'm looking for someone. Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes! Yeah ... Help you I can ... yes ... yes. I'm looking for a great warrior. A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great. Beg pardon? You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get! Five. The five longest. Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A? And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine -- Adenoids? Lumbago. Yours? You take it. I don't know. I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh? I think maybe you'd better. And Connell I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars. Yes. Sure. The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu... That's all he said. Same here. The pleasure is mine. Was that Lincoln James I seen run off? He's fine. Just had a bad fall. Why's his britches round his knees? R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place. Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet. Possible.  So you did those wings? Yeah.  A long time ago. They're harder to do than they look. Oh?  You've tried? Well, I do a little drawing -- Not that I can see. Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts. If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it. Even pigeons aren't peaceful. One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people. Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea! What? He says it's a bad idea! What's a bad idea? How do you know him? We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place. Can I go now? You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit. He could see me. I'll quit, maybe you should start. I'll talk to you tomorrow. That's what you said before. I know. Goodbye. Like popcorn? I got some hair stuff. Dude, this is all I got. Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy. Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour? The easy way. Why do I keep doing this? Why, indeed? Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family... Dr. Meridian... He's a very stubborn man sometimes... You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles. He told you. He told me. And what did you say? I said it didn't sound like you. Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem? The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked. Where you comin' from?! Uh... basement I think... <u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!! This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for? Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting? I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place. You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer? She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible? It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs. The Fortress moves? Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice. Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us. No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us. Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us. You have not slept in two days. Nor will I, till my bride is beside me. Too much... too fast...? Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame. Betty Elms? Yes. I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you. Very pleased to meet you. Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone. Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure. Say, I want to be sure, too! Who's that? You never heard of Snake Plissken? Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems -- -- fuck you! WHY? Yes. But surely you know...? Fuck me!  Yes! Uh... You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around... I'm not sure... I might have. Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you? Well... I gues I would... Yeah. Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America. In the car? In the car. I see what you mean. Please! But how'll I put on the slipper, sir? Well, hello. Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me. Well, I don't. You've passed me on the street almost every day. Me? Uh-huh. Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you. Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap. I never said I could ad-lib... Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again. Lucille? Where do you get that? That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille. Innocent? Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me. But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature? You know darn well it is. Gentlemen, the prosecution rests. Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone? I'm through with you. What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences. I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything. Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose. Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up. Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might-- Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle! I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ... No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now. Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed. Howard, give him the keys... Gimme the keys to get outta here! Why can't I have a bank account? I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account! I'm going to buy a cattle ranch. Cattle ranch! I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too. That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break. That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job. There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing. May I use your pen? It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there. I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on... Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir. Captain who? Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived. Really? Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking. What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now. I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck. Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way... Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw! We're not?  How do you figure that? We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it. We've got to go now, then. That's right. Then Sally comes too. I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind. But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him. Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot; That's right. But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization. The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot; What position did you occupy? At first, like everybody, I was a soldier. How'd you know I was in here? The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back. Black suits you. Sorry? What s in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children? Yes. Yes what? Uh, yes, it is important. Why d'you wanna leave all this? You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty... In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond. I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships. Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them. I'm sorry. The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem. Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver? Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon. I appreciate your time - Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait. Where can I find him? Him? He, is a she -  at the bar. I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide. I'm not hiding. I'm right here. You killed Lauren! You killed her! What are they? Fertility beads. Ah. Which means -- The cabinets have to be redone -- It's really cold. Yeah. It smells like snow. Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together... It's undamaged? Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape. So you can use it now? Yes... I suppose so. Go back to your own time? I could... Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle? Yes. Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger? No. Why didn't you tell me? I was trying to protect you from this... See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom! Well, boo-fucking-hoo. The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic -- No. It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69. It's the cops.  Shit! How'd that happen? ... -- Oz -- has spoken! Who are you? Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz. You are? Dade. What? Thanks for your help. Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do? We found him like this... An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you... Here here! What's that long building over there? Storage, I think. Not with those smokestacks it's not. Does it hurt? Of course it hurts. What does it look like? I thought maybe he was pretending. Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am. I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now! That's very colorful, chief. Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute. I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life. Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!! First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it? I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost. Just no pleasing you, is there? Just admit you're wrong. We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy? Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old. No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up. Here it comes, poor Tom. But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right. That is so unfair. What's happening to me? What are you doing? You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor. Where did you sleep? I didn't. I hope the block is still standing. We're still standing. What's up with this shit. I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older. Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know. In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts. Yes. I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator. Has he been prepped? Ready to go.  Who signs for him? I do. Outside. Check him out. Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch? I drink. How does it affect you? My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay. And what if amateurs try it? I'll probably kill them. Is that likely? No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife. Well, not exactly s... Why does Rachel scream? What does he want? He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting. Come with me. And stay in the room. ...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece? Okay. I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later. Ahh--then she's still alive. She's fine.  Please-- And still Mrs. Harold Ryan? Will you please go?  An emergency! She still has just the one child-- the boy? It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief. Who did they get for that? You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up? Well, a ball player. No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame. Listen...the Heart. Yes...slowed down agreat deal. There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will? I am still owed money for this play, Burbage. Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men? When I have fifty pounds. I can come back. No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving. You're acting like a crazy person. You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once. What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time? You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me. Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass! Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business. Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out. Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe. Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me? Later. I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man. Cease fire with the bullshit. Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right. So, who is he? We have to know him. Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show. How? Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated. What are they doing now? Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked. Who do you think the Jap is? Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know? I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him. Easy, now. This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up -- Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask. Do you need a secretary? You kiss your mother with that mouth? I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know... What? One of the printers. You should get Married. That's what I should do.  Tell me why? Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance.... Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...? I know you didn't You know, Andy thinks you're doing this. Doesn't that scare you? No. Why? Because I think he's wrong. I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars? Nope. Come on. I'll see you there. What? I'll see you there. What are you talking about? I'll get him. There's not enough time. Yes, there is. Let's get organized. Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield. That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids? Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet! So sorry. I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone. Yeah. Donald Segretti? That's right. Well, I've gotta be running. Okay. See ya. Political. Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. It's not here, Caesar. Where, then? I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here. Great car. The best. I love that car. I'm very happy for you two. The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith. I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now. There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall. Must have been all the liquor in him. Quiet please. Does she suffer? I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing. Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong. Okay.  Lowell? Yeah? You're sure you want to do this? Why? Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man. You ready...? Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision? Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there... Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access... Hi there. Hi. He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born? I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment. Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife -- Oh indeed? Nice to meet you, Wally. Shhh!  They're sleeping. Tell me how all this works. Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a - Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out. It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that! Give me a date, Doctor. Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you? Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual. We're all professionals here, Miss ... Barrett.  Dana Barrett. Why? Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything. She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson. Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something. Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate. It truly is. I gotta, I gotta go...! Alonzo... What...? Alonzo, you don't need to go home. Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk. Talk. I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer. Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante... No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest. A quest? But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you. The Little... They work for Him. Him...? God... I'm the janitor of God. Gabriela ...? Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure. So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day? You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises? Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over. Uh-huh. Double ought. They'll give you a wallop. We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'. You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling. Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest. Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that? Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary. I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look! You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels    the oldest champagne    the richest caviar    the hottest music, and the prettiest wife! Good things... What are you sure about? But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness. I don't think that's going to happen. And why not? Because... You Harlin? Nope.  Darrell. Harlin around? He's up at the Look Out. Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny? It ain't nobody. It's a company. It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that. Did you ever kill a man? When I ask questions, I like to hear answers. They went on like I told you. Do what I tell you, it's not a game. It's all a game, don't bother me. Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them. Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does? Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you. But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that. Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back. Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me? Want a list? Wait, I hear something! Can I take your coat? You're cold? Hey, Miles. Long time no see. Gary. When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it. Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week. My condolences. What are you pouring tonight? Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste? Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding. Bathroom? Round back. Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth. Don't tread on the earth? You know, this, what you're doing with your life... I don't know. You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy. Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me. Oh, it's very complicated, huh? That's right. Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm? Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run. Sounds good. I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success. Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible. Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he? Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face. You punched the President in the face? He wasn't the President then. If I'm wrong, we're both dead.. This is not about martyrdom. You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons -- Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind -- Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day. Have you done your homework, honey? Yes, mom -- Then here's a little bump. Here we are. Well, son, you're home! Finish him, Ned. He ain't dead? You didn't get him? He got the boy's horse. It's getting cold. You think I'd really drink that? You don't think I put something in it, do you? You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink. I did do that, didn't I? Hey, Sal. I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You re here for the highland flings, I bet. I get all the glamour jobs. The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you. I don't want to hear it anymore. No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent. Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows. Oh, well, then you better listen to him. Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl. Then we'll have to see what can be arranged. Aye, do. You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand. If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign. Bluff. You've waited too long. For five hundred, what do I get? I go home and paint the kitchen. For two hundred? I stick around and wait for the five hundred. You mentioned information. Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it. A thousand. Got it on you? Got the information on you? Get it in half an hour. What is it? Someone's following me. Who? Sister Marguerite I think. Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night. Have you read it? No, but I certainly shall. Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular? I don't know. Think. I thought everything WAS arranged. Well, there's a problem. What problem? I'm not here to fight. Just stay back. I want to talk to you. Kenny. Camera. Now. I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me. That's good. At least they're interested. Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors   anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand? Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me? Yeah   I'd do that... You could teach me. Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent. Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit? I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me. Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves. But I see them. Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint. Hell, you think I am? I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing. You think I should hang around more with the crew? Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka? Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week. I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home. What did your wife get her? We got the same thing. That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38? Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what? Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand? Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...! Holy shit... you're dead, man... Victims.  Aren't we all. Hello? Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night. Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow. Bye. That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant. Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid. Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle? Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident. Did you ever think life would turn out like this? No. You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it. No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me? Who said I...wait, what? I don't think she's such hot stuff. When are we going out?  You and me? Not tonight. You going with Patrick? What?!  She wants what?! She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights. John, what if she kidnaps him. Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she? She lives her own life in New Jersey, America. You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives. How's it going?  Everything okay? Just like old times. Just like old times? Just about.. When can I squeeze one out? Not until like... eighth grade. Hey. Hey. Nice tie. Don't get too attached. Oh, no... What? There's a cop behind us. You finish the reading for E-con? Yeah. What'd it say? Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all. Whatever, big head. ... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose. MacReady...? He's one of them. When do you think it got to him? I'm only looking out for you. And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke. What are they doing? Claiming their place in the world. You want to share it? Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck. Right. Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over. Go away! Leave me alone. You know, we might just pull this off. Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.    Terry, you're bleeding. Do what I told you. Take care of Charley. Terry, for God's sake. Get out of my way. No, I can't let you. I can't, you're  Pointless. No. I don't think so. David? Who's there? Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you. Did you speak to Farlow? Yes. We're suing. Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story. David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you? A little. Sorry. Thanks. Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you. Has anyone seen Greg? He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored... Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst. What happens if he doesn't take the serum? The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure -- No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something. Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience. Turn that off!  Get the bags. Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog. For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg. Wait...I need that... Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing. Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask. Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you. For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment. What had you to do with this, Mother? He is your brother! He is nothing now. You typed this report? Yes, sir.  Anything wrong? Wrong?  Look at this! What other bunch? The thieves. I'm not a thief. Then who are you? I'm their ride. Is that you? Me. Yes. Oh. And that is -- mom? Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother. You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes. Hey, Rene. Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business. I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand. Hurry up. So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do? No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites. No... No? NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant! Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son. Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor. That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight. Hey.  You learn from doing. Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least... Yes, quite. We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane. Show Mr. Van Orton to his room. The key? Hm? Is there a room key? Didn't I give you two? No, you didn't... It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception. And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception? Nothing happened between me and Tia. Leave.  Now. Can I say something in my defense? No. I don't really feel like talking anymore. Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you -- Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown. We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt. There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain. Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again. That's right ... Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap -- I don't know anything about that. ... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ... It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it. It's too late! Nooooo! I wonder if you could help me. What? I said I wonder if you could help me. Why didn't you wait for me? We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up. That's not true. Here I am. Partners? Partners. Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer? Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know? Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you? Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand? Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion. Good idea. You see the three-quarter socket? Yeah.  Down there. Shit. Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber. Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side? Huge. What are you hoping to find inside? Black. Hey, this is fun. I had no idea you'd be this good! Neither did I! There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed. We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different. What ... What ... ? What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature. I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops. The job manages to keep me pretty busy. Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest. Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir? Ummmm . . . You the man. You better believe it. Yes. What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll? A child who can't die... Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley? I give up. Who are you? I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct? I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle. I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield? No. I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice. Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence - So you need to change, right? Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable. Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape? I don't know. I can't really tell from here. He is. It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military. Look. And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car. Would you excuse us, please. I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go. Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it. What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden? I'm just saying... You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night. Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges. What of it?  Haven't we waited forever... ?  Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag? Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died. Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you. You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me.. And...your point? No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over! I know you're going to jump. It's done? Not... totally. What's the problem? Ready? Yeah.  One, two, three... At-at-at-at-at. Knock it off! Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts. Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing? I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. No you're not. There was a body! I swear it! Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming. I wasn't dreaming. I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape. Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it. Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him. Between... Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight? Great. How's Austin? He's asleep. You didn't... Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch. Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand? Hugh Kane. So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days. I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess. Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you. What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson. When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates. They asked me to help. I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution? WE CAN'T BREAK FREE! IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS! Moving story. Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors. Is that true? Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?. Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp. How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog! Emily Dickinson. I wouldn't know. Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What? I want you to go on this trip. No, sir... I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook. The stiff one eye? Two days. I can't. I work. You take off when you have to. My son. Bettes tells me he's doing fine. Melvin, I'd rather not. What's that got to do with it? Funny, I thought it was a strong point. Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go. Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!? Is there another way to see it? No. Treadstone. Never heard of it. That's not gonna fly. With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade. Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle... ... no uncoded messages on an open channel... So you have the answers... Ah! You have questions? What are we? Nothing if not vampires... Who made us what we are? Surely you know the one who made you... But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil... Never again, never again... I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry... No more dentists, no more dentists... It'll get better now. I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke. Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit. What? I said I'll drop it. That bag's almost empty. No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it. Robert, you leave it up these people...! This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility. This concrete?  This is still America. What do you hear? He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here. Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind. Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to. No. No. I can't. If Ram n ever found me on a picket line ... What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us! I did kill us. She thinks we re dead. And she thinks she got away with it. What the hell are you talking about? It s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium. Who s she? Elektra King. Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline. Makes her look even more innocent. What would she want with weapons grade plutonium? I was hoping you could tell me. What's that? Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE. Seconds and thirds, too. Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual. You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff. Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you. Hi. Having a good time? ...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty. Why? Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste. [I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.] [Lucky how?] [That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.] [And?] [And I had my men ready.] [You stole the drop.] Barbatus! Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad? No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks. No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs... Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere! I wonder...what...was it all...for... Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!! Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life... OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!! YOU BASTARD!! What the hell are dreams, anyway? Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died. I'm in the bath, mom. Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch. Okay. Where is he? He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken. She hasn't mentioned this. She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it. Don't you have friends? I have friends. A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends. I'm not pretty. Well... not in the common way. Damn...damn...damn... Hey, are you okay? No...I m not... Is there anything I can do for you? Does anyone know his politics? No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must. Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier? I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for. You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous. You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life? I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality. Some reality. No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is. Why not? Because you'll use it against me. Won't you? It's just us now. I know. Dave. Yes. You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads? Yes. Got something to say to me, Nick? ...ttt..tt... two out of three? That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer -- Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us. How's everything, Gus? I can't complain. What's in your socks? Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes. What can I get you? Sleep. I took some of your Vicodin. I know.  Why? I like how it feels not to feel. Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you -- We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us. Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear. I don't know what we're talking about. We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone? You're asking me a direct question? Yes. I thought you were never going to do that. It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen. No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist. It's all the same. It's accelerating. You have no more time for games. Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge. A lot's happened since we last saw each other. Yes. I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise". Looking for me? Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk. Satisfied with your cabin? Fine. We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood". Would you really have drawn my blood? If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one. I snuck into #21. Why would you do a thing like -- You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. The Day Care? We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre? No. Keep all energy to the armor. Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours. We had an off night, that's all. So when are we gonna have an on night? My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property. Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color? Mary is Lila's sister? Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway... Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam. He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates... Norman took a wife? No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and... I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to. Appreciate it, sir. I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal. Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business. I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond. Your Majesty. What do you love so much? Your Majesty Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love? I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed They are not acted for you, they are acted for me. All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left. Right, Bob. Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of... ...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted... Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion... You've got nothing, you don't have a witness... And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime. He told you that... He didn't have to tell... I want to talk to him.  Would you ex... Oh, you're his attorney, too...? Later for you, pal. Okay... Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey? About a dozen officers and men. With some on the planet... Real effective security... You could have just flashed him your badge, you know? Authority still makes me nervous. If there is anything else, don't hesitate -- I won't. How long have I got? You're putting me on the spot, Bill. Nichts danke. Kein. Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing. Hello, L.A. Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour. You bet. Your place? I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in. OK. ) You feel the symptoms? My friend -- what can one say -- You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet. What? Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game. I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable - No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays. What others? Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me. Is there space here? Yes. Do you need anything else? No, no thanks. Where are we? Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes. The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more? No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible! Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies -- Why is it -- breaking up? I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden -- The heater's here. Were you fooling with the power? No. Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me! You'd hold us back. We have to go on. Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on. Is it a girl? Is what a girl? Whatever it is you're upset about. Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things. In general. That's right. Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations. You never spoke so well of him. He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come. You lie. P.E.T.N ... What? What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here. Says who? Says me. You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands. Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them. Uhhh... teeth. Teeth. Sorry. If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it. It was one incident. Tell that to the families of the policemen who died. Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business. This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this? That will be just about enough! Now get out of here! I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you. There's a better place for us to eat. Did something happen; are you alright? Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine. Yeah, but whose point of view? Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view. Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin? Quite impressive. Thank you, Herr Doctor. I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it. I will. You will what? I will loan you the money. Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial? Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now. Who is it? It's Choi. Let's say for example - This I had to see myself. Hey, don't I get an encore? Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'. But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh. And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel! Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum... An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison. Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in. Just because you got 'em to laugh? A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life. I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety. I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal! Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal. You don't know any way you'll trust me? Nothing comes to mind. It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore. Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun. No, really... Hello, George.  Cigarette? Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure. We've had plenty of it the last few days. It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all. Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here. You talk as though you intend on staying. Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before? What are you talking about? I don't know. You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill. Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there? Lucky, I guess. That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture? Uh huh. It looks so soft. Your compliment was sufficient Luis. I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it. Not Caesar. Why? Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan. Hello, remember me? Hell yeah, I remember you. I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes. It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys. I just wanted to give you this. What will this prove? You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to. So? So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. And what happens when you lose? If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present. Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway... Franco mother-fucking Harris! Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee. You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work? I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit. That machine. I know.  It's ancient. It's a rhythm section.  The beat. That's not the point. Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately. You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow. No, I can't... Will you let me talk to you, please? I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that. Oh. You have to tell me that. What?! I can't hear you! But he is gone. I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur F lix lives? No -- but I will ask. I've seen worse.  Much worse. Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all. Quiet.  Would I get the loans? This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I? You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris. You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home. Ask her. Can the kid walk? Do you have anything smaller? Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables. There is nothing. Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that. Very sorry, but you see, no rats! No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific. How nice. It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and -- Bye, Johnny... What? Yes -- there -- Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up. I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it. Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>. If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand -- There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that -- It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily? Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain -- What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation. All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but -- It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people. Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog. You're not serious. I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car! God willing. We have to find the dog, Ryan. Why? Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog? Excuse me? All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH. Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling. I did too. It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from? When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way. So you saved her. Yeah.  But not for long. Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is. Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it. George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold... Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk? They are... friends of Congress. Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went? For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show. Oh, you mean on TV. No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love. Great. ...such a pleasant sound. Mmm. Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that... Yes... ...that. I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant! Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man! It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money! Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me? Sir, yes, sir! LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs! I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge. I got shells too, box and a half, tops. A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through? Put it on. JOSE! Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we? He said he heard hammering. Who? Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out. So when did Buddy leave? For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on. You think he killed anybody in Korea? They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this? No-- Me neither. Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat... It has nothing to do with him. Well, what does it have to do with? Us? No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once? Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me. Just wanted ta say hello. As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court. You did good, Massey! Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement. And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried. They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated. She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh. Jennifer needs me. Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to? I'm on duty. Do you know something about that? Why do you think I called? I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things. Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets. Toilets? I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that. Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see? Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me. Hey, come here, guy. Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask. Uh-oh... It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay? Harold? Maude???! They have noble faces. I've always thought that myself. Oh, yes. Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy. You're there now? Oui. You're calling me on your cell phone, right? No. You're calling me on is phone? Oui. My number's going to show up on his bill! Should I call you back? I can feel air. Me too. It's getting stronger. I'm close. If I could be of any help... I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal. Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky? What do you want? Shrimp and fries. I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here. I need you to teach me. Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink? I'm serious. I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37. Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck. Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. How about a hippopotamus? Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus! Supposin' you met an elephant? I'd wrap him up in cellophant! And when is the next lesson? Tomorrow. Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park. How many? Four of them. You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died. I wish she hadn't. I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die. Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not? Not far. Just a little way. No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car. I'll pay extra How much? Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints! Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl. Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl. Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me? Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude. She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni... So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck. What...does it turn to? It turns to steaming piss. You were quick enough to get Tom's help when... Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead. Why? Good question. You took the bait. C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there. This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her. Boy, did you see her go? Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub. Yes? Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont. Where? Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N  Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job -- What the fuck is going on. He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters. What's going ON!!! What's she singing about? What do you think? He's his own boss, and very competent. And with prison record. Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify. When did he call? This morning. On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait. Buffy!  Looking tasty. Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey? I look like a total wanker, don t I? Yeah, kind of. Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together. This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah. But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it.. I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'... Maybe just a little around the edges. Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan. The name is Lonnegan. Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have. Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! A ragione. A ragione. Hmm. C'e questa... Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today? I didn't want to say anything. Why? I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter. What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it? Kinda. I don't talk about her that much. Oh no? I didn't mention her once today. Well, until now. Tend the pin. Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ... Double-meaning intended, right? Right ... Okay. Okay. Now please, Reggie -- cut it out. Okay. What are you doing? Cutting it out. Who told you to do that? You did. But I'm not through complaining yet. Oh. Scottie, why are we here? I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time. But why? Why here? Madeleine died here. Get him on the phone. He's on the Island, he'll be back on... Get him on the... Where's it gone? Inside, Vince. Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that? Got that. Good. Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks! Read you loud and clear, Indy! Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook? No, I do not have any of those. Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist? I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors. ... Joe? Who's Joe? Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952. 1952...? Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book. Got a reason to stay. That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery? It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack. Did we go sailing? Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up. Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am. Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass. Oh God. Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house. ...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it. Then how are you supposed to get back? Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me. The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective. Ready quantum torpedo. It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming. You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart? You switched the charts; you tell me. I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body. Really? Will you live here? No. Why not? Pop don't like Johnny. But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave! Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority. Don't mind what she says, Chris. How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money. I'll get some. You've said that for weeks. I know. Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money. Chris! All right.  All right. I couldn't go near that woman. I said all right! Champagne please. Make that two. Ford, you were right! Ye-ah. It's only a little way, Mr. August. I'd like to get out of here. No. You have a name, missy? Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. We're waiting. Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world? Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God? For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart? All right, motherfucker, that's it. You mind? I'm eating, huh? Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you? I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it. Used you? I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand. War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me. I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay? There were two.  Not one.  But two. I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry. Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens. <u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons. I'm sorry, was there a question in there? Any other bags, Dr. Johnson? Just that.  Careful, it's heavy. Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting? Yeah, that's clerical. No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things. It's not just a gag, huh? No, it's, uh... a real big favor. No, Chinese food is fine. Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker. You're worth every last penny. Well, I can't let you down now, can I? See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans? Nothing is easy. How long have we known each other, Jerry? Six months.  Eleven days. Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to? But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color... Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius! Oh, Matt . . . Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right. Daughter -- my daughter -- She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew. Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church. We're all like that. Are you religious? No. You should be. How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him? No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy. So who won the bet? I did. Who? John Doe, the one in the speech. Oh. Yeah. You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him. What's this?  Why did you change it? You've seen enough. You know I don't feel well. Eat your dinner. Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels. Did the wife confess? When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything. Good-bye, Maxine. Whatever. We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement. You lied to me! I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it. This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you. I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me. Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off! Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that? I think so. One right, two lefts... And a right. Right. What? I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes. Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us? Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife..... Did you talk to him? Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go? Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me. If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that... So I'm saying it... It's too late... What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late. Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him. So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know... Jackie? What? Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life... We're <u>all</u> risking our lives! That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here! You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you? Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow! You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for? Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot! You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago! It's them.  They did this. It's a flat tire.  That's all. How do you know? We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself. Okay... okay. See you at seven-thirty in the lounge. I'll be there--Good-by. Well? You have changed since second grade. I mean, what do you think? You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain. Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny. You wouldn't kiss him, huh? Not with my mouth open. Good girl. Praise Jesus! I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too. But you have to.  They said you would. The precogs were wrong. If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing! Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do? Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do. Nothing. Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here. That's right. Have you anything to suggest? I don't know. Let me give it some thought. All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him. He came to my mind recently, that's all. How did you find out about the toxin? Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him. You're not capable of it. I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember? I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again. Someday, I'll find out. You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip. I shouldn't have asked you to come. You asked me not to come. Promise you won't go inside. Fifteen minutes. I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time. We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath. Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault. I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay? What is it? I have no idea.  Are you ready? Excellency! Madame. How can I help you? Man, that movie gets better every time I see it! Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that. You think that <u>is</u> the truth. I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real. And what do you believe? -hold it, hold it- What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book? -- wait, just wait -- -- well, when does it get good? Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea. Oh Christ. Doc... Dear God. Don't open that! Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look -- Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck? I was told that the family wanted examination of the head. As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not? I had the cause of death. Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck? Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said... you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can. What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand. But I could understand. I want to understand! I LOVE him! Do not tell me that! I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!! And howls Alison? She's ... well, she's good. Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking. Yes, isn't he. It's great when people who work together can become real friends. Isn't it? No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you? Sam Lowry. Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting. Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console? What? I'll bring it back in ten minutes. You want to take my console into your office? Yes. I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you. Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate... Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is. You ain't heard from him? No I ain't. Nothin'? Not word one. Would you tell me if you had? Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you. It's not me he's in trouble with. Who's he in trouble with then? Some pretty bad people. Llewelyn can take care of hisself. These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit. He won't neither. He never has. I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is. He can take all comers. I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself. For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them. Of course. Nice try. Everyone thinks I did. That's because I wanted them to! I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name. I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass. True enough. You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me. I don't care for him. He's your brother. So? Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore. It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong. The guy might not have been carrying anything. Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. What are you drinking, love? I've forgotten. Steve? What about that ugly dog? I got my mase. When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me. Why would you lose me? The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave. Why would I want to leave? I like it here. That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true. It is. Can I come over after Jamie's asleep? My parents are going to come home early tonight. So? I don't know Brady. Okay, I guess. I'll call you later. Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try? I want Trix!  Mommy! If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official. You think of everything, don't you? And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo. I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was? Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that... It's a novel. About me! Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally. What are you saying? Hello?  Last birthday was? I don't look my age, Joe. Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently. It's a shit novel anyway. Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress. Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway. Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally. Who?  Who?  Who thinks that? Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally. Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal? I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity. Thanks. We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where. Do that. I thought he was the Chief Engineer. He is. Then when is he going to Engineering? Are you 'fucking with me!? The gun... What about the gun? It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it. You... Okay, enough of this shit. Alright, asshole. Did you see it here in New York? San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East. I can't... You have to! Quickly! ...imagine a better grape for the region. I am one lucky guy. Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out. But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now. He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would. I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie. It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage. Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right? I don't think so... Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look. That's wonderful! Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed. How did you get this number? Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes? I'm on my way. Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review. Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records-- Actually, it didn't come from me. Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me... I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK? Why don't you ask for another one? Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds. ... my friend doesn't like it here either. All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend. Well he's not exactly a friend. Is he an enemy? Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend. -- sort of a boyfriend? Sort of. I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you. Johnny! My God, did I say that? I don't believe it. Why don't you get some rest? I've got to work. You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on... You're going to stay here...? Yes. I will not leave without the twins. We have to get out of here Tatiana. Please, please try one more time. I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise. What the fuck?  Is he going to walk? He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals. Soldier -- where''s your C.O.? Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell -- Well , who's in command here? I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man -- Elena. Elena Hood, am I right? Yes. Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year. Yes, it was -- I ended up -- No need to make excuses -- Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her. Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques. Come on, Dad. Come on! What about the boat? We're not going on the boat? Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me? I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition. I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days. Oh my...  Don't leave... G'night. Hey.  I got another question for you. What's that? Yes. I've been wanting to meet you. Why? Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman? I'm not. Well you own a lot of land. Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it. How much of that letter was on the up and up? Every word of it. Not quite.  This wasn't here. No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am. Yeah ... yeah, it looks different. Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it. A girl?  Anyone I should know? Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean? Oh. Oh. Hello. I wasn't expecting you. ...a week ago. It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters. See my hips? Yep. I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius. When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain. But you were pulling your hips last night. So...Wanta make love? Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is? Well...I guess not. It's a place where the dead speak, Missy. I can't believe you did that. I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money. It was my fucking television. Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that? He's not part of the program. Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life. All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear. Oh shit. Bullseye! Stop the car!  Now!! But tell me -- She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances. What circumstances? Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital. But what does your intuition tell you...? Groom-  - may I have a wedding present? What would you like? Texas? I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go. Maybe one of the original crew? No. It was someone else. Who? Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something... I've often thought about going back. You have? Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain. He sounds like a person worth while knowing. He went back for his brother. We said 48 hours. That's a long time to be in jail. Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops? What? If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose? That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass -- Fuck you, Roy Ostrey! -- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife -- Don't hit the face! Not the face!! Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now! Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break. Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb. Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs. The what? The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket. Mommy please help me! Don't be afraid! Daddy, please!!! I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same. You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy. Oh, Harold. You are so young. Now you will read this into the tape recorder. I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming. You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...? Hold on a second. I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did? What time are visiting hours? I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning. Well. Okay. Jeffrey, when you see your father. Yeah? He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you. What? It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him. Thanks a lot, Mom. .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so. Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a... Murray said... John.  John... Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads... ...ah, fuck this... The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per... That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross. Either way.  You're out. I'm out. Yes. I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. Are we adrift-- If I don't get power up we are! Drop the anchor! We can't--it's power driven! Get your men to do it! The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?! What friend? Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you. What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? Barely. You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you? And you still believe he's going to come here? Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable. Do you think she loves him? She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him. They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man. You gave them me. I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along. All it takes is one second? Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways. I'm gonna start rolling -- -- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette? Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start -- Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process. You're one man. You can't save everybody. What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one? Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this. What do you mean? I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend. Can't.  Need water. You've had today's water. Thirsty. Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it. No water, no work. Two-fifty. Two-fifty? They go up? Always two-fifty, my friend. Hey, great they're back. Whoopie fucking doo. You're poisoning that child's mind. I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve... You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents -- They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways. How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors! No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism. That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure. I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford. Come on. Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything. Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. But the lady says  Oh, for chrissakes... Robert, let's not be rude, okay? Nick, Alex, how are we today? How'd you know it was us? Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live. You got everything you ever wanted. Except the girl. The only one that really mattered. Do you want me to stop calling? Look, I'll call you, okay? You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions. We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise. What are you thinking? Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me. That's because he misses you. Let the child stay. Now, I don't know Amy -- As for the author... shoot him. A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot. But I am history. Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed... Yes? No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses. on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops. Yes, M'sieu Laval? Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute. There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear. What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband. Stomach's gone. But... okay. I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital. I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor. I understand. I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got? Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got. I've got three big ones. I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes. No, no... I have three billion dollars. I have to be home in twenty minutes. I don't have to be home 'til two. From Miss Johnson -- Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us? Yes? - - shut up. Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way. But he's a policeman -- He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark? Must be somebody? ...there's nobody. You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a... Who gives a shit! --I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the-- Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above-- But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered-- Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits-- Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this? Have you lost all control of this city? I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully. I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now. She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile. Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile? That's what I said. No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album. It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong. You can be and are wrong. If you only mean to dupe me again -- Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine? I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter? I found Lisa Henderson. Did you?  What's she doing? Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like. Really?  Was the third act too intense? No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk. But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed. Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk. That's your father's diary, Ann. Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary. There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me. You bet I will, Ma. What the hell are we arguing about? I don't know...You...I don't know. He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved. I -- I -- No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go... Something's weird. What? I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you? Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete... Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load! How long have you been watching me? I have something I have to show you... You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy. Oh? And what's that? Sit still, look less like a meal. I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew. Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views. I don't think about it. Yes? He's not an ordinary man. Enough ROmance. He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt! The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you -- Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream -- He's a man of God; he's true to his vows. First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it. Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now... Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent. C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time. And they get caught! That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes. I get my revenge and make some fast cash. It s over, Cotton. Not until you re dead. Let me guess--breakfast is served? No. What then? I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me. That's what you're supposed to say. This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness. You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you! I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel. It couldn't! I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours. Fish can't feel. Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you. Such as?... The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots. Tell me about its sexual roots. It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth. I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had. Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there. Go on. And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge. You learned this in some college course? I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that. The doctor. Yes. And what is his most cherished possession? His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess. And he keeps it in his apartment? Yes. And no one's there now? I don't think so. That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do. What are you going to do? He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin. No you're not! Why not? Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye. Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom. Yes, Dad. You understand? Not even her? I embellished. Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."? I embroidered. ...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"? I lied. Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself... So your memory's coming back? Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he? Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery? No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name? In His name?? Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven! Really? You feel better now, right? Jungle man fix Jane. No more fights? No more fights. Good. No more nightmares for either of us then. Can you see? Yes. It is the Western Ocean. Hey, Mike? What? Are you all right? I think we're making a lot of noise. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'. Why? Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore. C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve. That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it. What? Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep. You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...? No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know. It's the truth, I swear. All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face? Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it? Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it... You talk very fast. Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that. I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty. Five thirty.  Okay. Try not to be late because kids don t like to be the last one picked up. Got it.  Good tip. Bye... Is it nice? The Soho Grand? Yeah. You're from LA, right? Yeah. You'll love it. You fool -- you damn fool. Come on, Fran. Goodbye, Mr. Baxter. I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin. I don't know you... I don't think I...Larry? I have about seventy-three... Will you take a check? Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest. Are you all right? ... right as rain. There's a better place for us to eat. Did something happen; are you alright? Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine. Is that your final answer? Yeah. Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight! ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam... What? Palace? Hardly. Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City... When I wanted to. It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty. Hi. You're Shelly? I'm sorry. Should we buy it? Are you kidding? We'll take it. What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching? Your article sucked. In what sense? In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs. Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there. Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent. Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago. I'm trying to help. I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account. That's not ENTIRELY true. Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet? No, no. Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night. No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me. Are you going to stiff me? What do you mean? Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips. You want a tip? Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars. What do you mean? What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it. I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars. This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke. I'm very, very serious. But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him -- And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript - will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning. This is what it means right here. Small brains make your balls itch? You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp. What work? I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad. You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about. You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you? Sure, boss.  Sure you can. What's this? Get out of here, you! Hello.  What is your name? Long. See anything? I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising. There would be a moon tonight. A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of. Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em? I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ... Toddy hates me. Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you. Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife? Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know. Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there. Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down? Because they got wet. That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate? You run the plates? Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell. Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI? Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo. Theo, I want you to get out of this town. I'm getting to like it here. Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour? I gotta survive. He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life. You got a better offer? No... I didn't think so. If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two. Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank-- Awaiting my orders. You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well. I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse. You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement. No. I beg your pardon? Oh, I'm sorry. What're you doing? I'm sorry. Go on, tell me. Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby. Stop asking everyone. Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out. And our forces? We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours. We're being exterminated. A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half! Aye-aye sir. Engines to half. Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice. Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble. Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it. You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it? No! You're sure? Sure I'm sure! This car needs petrol. Shut up and drive! Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do. De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking. He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself... You're killin' me here. Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours. Oh, baby, you cruel... Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY! Worse... you're in Texas. Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red! I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six. Seven. Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that? I took care of everybody. Yeah? Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver. There are ads? For parents? Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit. Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch. You certainly will not. Oh no, those things frighten me. He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him. Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you. You just feel sorry for me. Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side. How'd you know I was here. Who else'd be in your truck. You heard it? How's that? You heard my -- you havin' fun with me? What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it. But -- how'd you know it was mine? I deduced it. Once you walked in. The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand. That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly? She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted. Do you have a romantic bone in your body? No, I'm all bowler hat, remember? Mac... let's get out of here. Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it. Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that? Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals! Yes, I'm pretty sure I would. That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted. Daddy, why can't I...? Did you hear what I said?  Come inside.... I don't want to.  I want to swing.... Dr. Green... I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there? They're all heavily armed. All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something. What was it? I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw. Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over. Say again?  All after incinerators? Can we get some coffee...? How ya doing? Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners. Still angry that I kissed ya, huh? If you call that a kiss. You just ripped my card in two! Yes. Hey, bud. What's your problem? From citizen high to citizen low. I don't care. Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power. That what you do? Yes. I try to keep my power. Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them... ...but:  this particular statue... Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"... ....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter... I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier. ...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so... How long was I out? Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling? Solid. Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press. Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal -- Front page? Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington. It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been? I had a fight up at Sportsman's. Well, you look it. You win? Draw. What's your record at? 5-5-1. Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money. Yeah, sure. I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight. I'm not sure I understand. Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times. I wouldn't imagine where. We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan? No.  Never heard of him. A Perry Russo? No. A Willie O'Keefe? No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name. Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that? Ohhh-hh, ohhh... Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes! I'm not hungry. That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it? Why yes. How did you know? Lucky guess. How you feeling? I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great. Looking for someone? You never know who you'll see. Now where do we go ? I don't know. Shall I answer it? No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week. What do you want. Amy? I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children. Can't you tell me later? But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me. Not that I can see. Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts. Keep what handy? Nothing. The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet. He's... dreamy.  He's... Yes, Mary? HE'S SO FINE... No -- No -- No -- No! Ohh!  OHH!  OHH! Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help! Chris.  We got it.  Let's go. Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin. You know what the Scottish call it? No. Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland? No, sir. Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think? I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now? Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>! Go back to the drawing board. She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you... She was killed, Penny. Oh, my. Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight. A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold? Well, I really don't drink... Oh, it's all right. It's organic. God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him. Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him. Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave. I'm in here. You're fucked. You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why? They're not very imaginative? Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt. Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away. Not before I settle with you. Christ, I don't believe this. Stand up. I wasn't hitting on your girl! Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit. I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay. That's GREAT! Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...? That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine. I'm Sugar Cane. I can put them in a good school. Any school you want. And get someone to help around the house. Yup. Oh my God.  Oh my God. Let me speak to Clarence. He wants to speak with you. You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie? That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves. So what, you left her there. I shot her. How many guys they have on you? I counted four. Well .. I didn't know that .. No .. You didn't know that .. Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison... What if I've figured a way? Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please... Yes, Saavik, go ahead... But first, a little juice.... And second? Mmmmmm. Wait a minute.  Promise me something. Anything.  Anything. That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them. You got it. Hello, Marty, when you come home? We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School. That's in France. Yeah, I know. Wait. Wait. That's better than gold when it's cold. Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"... My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together. Stay? They lived together all their years? Oh, yes... I think... You know who put the dope in your bag? Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that. They wanted you to tell them what you know. I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke. What did they want to know? Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me. Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again. Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved. Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk. We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs. Ready to go? We're not going anywhere. It bought us some time. And now we're all out of it. I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound. No fucking way. Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing. Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows! Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor. What? You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy! If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend -- You can trust me. Yes, I do. Nautilus? Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench? 285. Oh. Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take. And you're taking? They're yours. They are? The cards... you're bank. So who -- what -- are you? Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but... Can you show me? Small moves, Captain, small moves. Why did you contact us? You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years. And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others? Many others. And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built. Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers. So who...? We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here. The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here? Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far. So we passed some kind of test? You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation... It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they? They're coming. Feeling better? Yes, thanks. That's good. That's uh... good. You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back. Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy. I know all that. What about a summary then. I think we're through for the night. As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you? Hanging on every word. Good joke.  Wanna hear another one? I told you, Nick. Remember? Tell me again. All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way. Had some bad relationships, didn't you. Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things. Oskar! Ludwig? You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room. Sure. Maybe coffee. Phone's out. I hope the pipe's -- Have you decided about Pilgrim? What about him? Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down... I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that. I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it. Mom? Yeah? Maybe they should put me down too. What? I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me? May I help you, Master Grayson? How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there? Master Wayne's dead wives. I'm off. Wish you weren't. Do you know how much I love you? I want to speak with you, please. Who is it? I'm not sure-- --These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated. How're these? They'll do nicely. Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo -- Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days. I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then. If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him. Sun will be down in a minute. ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that. Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that. I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right? You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that. Why did you do that? Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack... Where's the dog? My husband's out looking for him. He run away often? That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right? Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium. Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night... Jack. What are you doing here? I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor? Yeah. You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they No I ain't. Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237? Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out! I don't suppose.... One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait. But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation. Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me. But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time. That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer. You think so? Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it. I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah. I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with. And after all, you have such morals. Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along? Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here. And what are they doing now, Mac? They are awaiting further information. ...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man   to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it. Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm... I'm cool. Could I try that? Don't you have anywhere to go? I've got plenty of places to go. Was that your sister? Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm. Funny. Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now. And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage. This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro. Be cool. Fake it if you have to. You really don't want me to play huh? No I do, Captain Howdy said no. Captain who? Captain Howdy. Who's Captain Howdy? You know, I make the questions and he does the answers. Oh, Captain Howdy.... He's nice. Oh I bet he is. Here I'll show you. I see where you're going. Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for? I'd go with the seven. Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out. How do you guarantee that? Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute. Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs. Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love? Me? Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy. Maybe.  Sure sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd   Yeah, but where you going to find her somebody that's real somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more. Good morning, mongrels! Good morning... That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning! Good MORNING! Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING! GOOD MORNING! Are you AFRAID? GOOD MORNING! Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour. You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable. I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties. I noticed. Do you see a toilet here you think is really me? I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons. Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother. That too tight? No. Mom's going to hate it. Always on my ass, anyway. Like you don't give her a hard time. Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you... Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth. What are you talking about? Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison. A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?! I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it -- Take your time. -- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass. What is that? That is my telescope. The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation? Does he know how to activate it? Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button. Fine.. Learn anything? Oh yeah. Good. I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations. This is insane.  You've got no proof. Puff, put the gun down. Ounpoo. Ungh. Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we? Unka unka unka unka unka. Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again. I have to talk. Is that okay? Gimme this god-... ...-damn phone. Talk to me. INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. What is it? Bang up stuff. What on earth's the matter with you? I ought to smack your face! I don't. I don't know him. Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead? Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on. Can you not go yourself. I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy. Can you stand something to eat? Love a cup of tea. With lemon. Sitcom...? And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie! I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes! George, I hate sitcoms. HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!! Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints! Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl. Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl. Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me? Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude. No gun.  How disarming. I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens? Dear daisy, don't despair. Here's another wire from Peter Warne. Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same. Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight? No. Her father loading up the shotgun? Stella! It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say. She's just not the girl for me. She's only perfect. Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want. Is what you want something you can discuss? But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski... Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows. You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it. Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas. About seven minutes. Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron -- Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass. Aye, sir! Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything? Not nobody, not nohow! Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now. Right here, sir. What have you been doing? Wandering. Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff. You pass that funky Cobra on the highway? Uh-uh. What Cobra? Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits. Oh, yeah. Good for him. I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it. Who are you and what are you doing here? I need one hundred thousand dollars. Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you? Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox. That depends. On what? Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It's quite out of the question. The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man? Like Job? Ah, but, we're asking about you. I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed. Why, may I ask? That's the question I want to ask Job. I don't know Job any more than he knows me. Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. Why should I? Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location. It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits. Mm - Hmmm... Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car? Very good. Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first. Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil? It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low -- Them kids is yours? My flesh and blood! Where's your Missus? What did he say? Nothing new. He's just going off duty. Did you say more? I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise. And why.  Is that? Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago. Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital. You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this? Just like this. What about sailing? The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light. It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful. How've you been? Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great. I was going to say... your eyes look a little red. I've been swimming, Merv. ...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do? I've gotta call the police   or you could call for me   Hold on   You gotta believe me   Hold on   I didn't do this, I did NOT do this  Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened. I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me! Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street? Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that. The country's loving it. The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists. Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man? No.  Have you? Oh, tell the story. --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui... Gorgeous. A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months. That's when you need to cement, and define define define. Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there. To the pools? To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz. Oh no -- _ 14. No!... It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste... Hey, your gonna regret this. Come on, Jeff. What? She ate. Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams. Ah! HOLLY  Now. Sure. I can follow that. It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it? Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you? Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit. Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately? She say what time I should call? The sooner the better. Anybody hungry? What'd you get? Some bread and... You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate? Yes. So, what do you do for a living? I'm a dancer. Really? Ballet? No. Exotic. Oh. Sorry. Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it. Forty-nine? INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out. It's not up to you to save me, Jack. You're right. Only you can do that. I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone. Keep stallin'. Alright, I'm coming...hold on. ... what? I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here. Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright. ... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?... And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits? You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures. You plan to drink both those beers? Sorry. Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop. I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out. Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry... Don't be. Your movie's a hit. Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching. People! Come on. "Parade" float. There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then... Wait'll you see it. Have you heard? No, I haven't heard. There was a second. What the hell? Where'd you get that stuff? Now many? Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out. Yeah, for sure. And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now! Who? Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building. Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back. You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it. If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber. Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick. Nick. Hey. How's things? Oh. You know. How's it with you? Same. Hey. Same old stuff. What's that noise? What? What's that noise? John Wayne... Listen, Nick -- Great. Hey. That's great. Listen, Nick -- John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out? I'm gonna stay here, Nick. What? Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean -- Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly -- I gotta get back, Nick. It goes away ... It'll go away. I don't want it to go away. He's paying out in stacks of 25. I can see. What's the problem? He wants to put a half million on Syphon. Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful. Wladek, please. You comfortable? Yeah, are you? Yeah. Prepare for a site-to-site transport. Sir, we won t be able to bring you back. It s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter... That's an order, Commander. You okay? I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine. Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work? I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands. A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think? I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins. The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it? If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it. Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time? Sure thing. We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true? Absolutely correct. Could you tell us a little about it? Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu. And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things? I get it now. You and me. We're dead. Dead? Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven. Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate. And some really fast cars. Was it Venza?  Did you get him? No. These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you. Reynolds? You've done your research. Remind me why I keep doing this. Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind. Oh, right -- Join the party, fellas. We're just going over a few things. You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you? Yes.  I've missed it. No.  The world has missed you. It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception. And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception? Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled. Rescued at last. Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup. Do you guys feel like painting? What color? Red. I love red!  That's my favorite color! Don t kill me! Shut up! Please... For who? Earl Williams. The reprieve. What's going on? Victor, are you feeling alright? Have you made any charges against him? No. Then he's coming home with his mother and me. All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave. ... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all. Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing. What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to. I am George. Tank, charge the E.M.P. Yes, sir. I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun What are they doing here? We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk. It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here. I wouldn't worry about that. I thought you two would get along. Yes. There are only ten. I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter. It would matter to us. There you are! This doesn't obligate me in any way. Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher - - The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum. It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives. So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about? What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British. Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I. David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy. Why? Why didn't you tell me? How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father. Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day. Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo? Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car. You should have put that on last night. I know. That way it sets. Yeah. I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane. I pray you: be succinct. You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case. With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix? Did I hear a car? Our equipment has arrived. Hmmm. Hudson, don't you understand... And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore. I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you... Oh.  Well, what's this? Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton? I... I need a drink of water. Go ahead, son. Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that. Frmpph-yrr. Fine. I don't want to hit you in the stomach! You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach. Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter... They're starlings. Is that right? I don't like starlings. Why not? They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy. The mother sure has her hands full. Saddam, would you let me do my job please! Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants. Shit! Hi. Hi. I thought I could give you a lift back. Are you coming home? Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things. My house? No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from. They're gonna mock our foibles. Our what? Our foibles, our foibles! She's right. They'll string her up. Do you want to come to Argo City? Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*? Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right. That's why Kong loves her! You goin' to the escort service? You got any better ideas? Mind if I ride along with you? This has nothing to do with your fire. But what if it does?  You might need my help. That could have been worse. Yeah. Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain. More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please. No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass. My name's not Christine.  It's not my real... Who the fuck cares? Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane. But of course you are. I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight... I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan... Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects.. I'm hungry. Smart lad.  Bring me my spices! Claire...Hey... This stuff is so sticky. Claire. It s all right, Ethan..you ll bring me back...won t you... I always have, Claire.. Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret. What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie? It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing. I don't know. There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt. I'd take him to the doctor. You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist. I'd kill it. As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command. Your honors, the State rests. Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice. This is madness, Wynn. Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell. It was you. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Why did you take Jamie? She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny. Jamie's baby ... There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween. Samhain. And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you. Hi. Is Shari here? No. What is she, at work? She left. Well, when will she be back? Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin! Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four! Lay off! The blonde is mine! I gotta, I gotta go...! Alonzo... What...? Alonzo, you don't need to go home. I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time. Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'. He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it... What are you doing? Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game... Fuck you. If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me. Caesar, this is crazy. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't. You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know... What difference does that... Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie. Look who's talking. Yeah, speak for yourself. No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do? I have an idea. And what would that be? Do you know me? Yes. Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl. You dream about dead guys? No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever... Just give me a chance, will you? I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it? Daddy? Uh huh? Are you...gonna go...away? What care the bones when the soul is free? Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets. Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour. Where are my goddamn books? Books? My journals! Where are they? He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow... I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on... Why? Because she's my...my... She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all! I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own... That don't make 'em kin... All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all. How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here... You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you. Never. He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do. That's not so. Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance... So you felt it too! Let him go, he said. Let him go. ... what? I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here. Stop it. Okay, "mom. So it don't exist. Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream. You know where she gets this from! You shut up. No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face. Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine. What do you think, Spock? What was your horse's name? Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before? Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse. Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...? It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City... Let me call you back... It's so shameful... Whatever it is -- it could save you. That's just it -- it would ruin me! How? Great game. Red Sox are winning. They're always winning. Until they lose. Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander. They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and... While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open! Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika. Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think? You do. Did you hear that? What? Did you hear what he said? What? He made, you know, a remark. Honey, are you okay? -- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood. Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar. I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me. It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics. You mind if I check things back here? It's fine. Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that? My troops don't make policy. Well, they die for it! We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl. <u>Liza</u>! You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope. You've never seen her run. Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I m in love with somebody else. I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard! Get out of here. That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement. In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up. Ellen Straub. It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right? Do I look like it that much? Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here. You fucking bastard. Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn. So all that bullshit about God and faith. It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away. You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did. Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge. You raised me, like a son. You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you? You killed my parents. I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you. Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now. I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb... The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo.. Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things. We can't raise the wheel without it. My horse doesn't work. What are you doing here? Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you. Well, here I am.  See? How are you doing? George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay. Dad. What? You can call me Dad if you want. I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone. Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on... What do you want from me? Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again. Do what you want, it's a free country. Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ... In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward. Yes. Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor. Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma? I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son. Do you really think that? Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference. I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways -- Wouldn't profit him none. Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you? Beth Shalom? It's Reform. So what? They're not that Jewish. I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they? ... well I'm glad you told me. Jesus. I had no idea... I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here. Where? In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you. Why don't you sit down? I'm not going to stay long; I can't. There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make. I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it. Why too late? Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli? His brother came to help him. I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now? On a plane back to Sicily. And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face. That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor. You would have killed his brother? Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe. In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance. Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar. But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in... I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on. I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought... Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now. Scan for vessels in pursuit! Is there something about the house? Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you. Hey!  Give me that baby! These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids. Nursemaid?! How about a cup of coffee? No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour? What happened to Gibarian? Didn't you talk to Snow? I want to hear your version. Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you? I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him? The same thing that could happen to any of us. Where's his body? In the lab.  With her, probably. Her?  Who are you talking about? You're welcome to my share of the spider webs. And it stinks to high heaven in here. You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you? No, I'm afraid not. I never have any luck. Here's your jacket! Uh, thanks... Animals. Yeah ... animals and s-s-s --- Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling. Too much school. I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up? Why would you want to be a cop? I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun. What is it? I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too? Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here. Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me. Sally? She gave me the evil eye. It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly. I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more. Well, she... I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up. You was a... a crazy sonofabitch. Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness. You ain't like that no more. Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none. Nor Quincy, I guess. Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared. You ain't like that no more. Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more. Helen, tell Matt I want to see him. Yes, sir. No! I'm sorry, John. No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us! I have to go away, John. Don't do it.  Please... don't go -- You said that malignant narcissism was not evil. Not pure evil.  That's correct. And also that... Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late. That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E. Not the most popular opinion, but yes. What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist? Don't go in. I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town. We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help. There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something. Let's try. Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa? That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch. What's he... Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore. It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible? It's just not. Why not, you stupid bastard? That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back. I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him? Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ... Double-meaning intended, right? Right ... Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you? Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito. Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead! Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control... When he makes that call. All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl. Well? Okay. So maybe you were right. Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy. What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams. But that's just not reality, Nancy! Listen...thank you. You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know? Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure... Jackie, will you hand me the mirror? Dunbar's telling the truth. Wrong answer -- We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him. Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first -- Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd -- Why do you think I ask? I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago. Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major? No, sir. Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe-- Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid-- Hey. It's sex time. Where are you?! We're coming your way, man! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all. That's always tough. How long were you together? Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend? No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's... By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it? Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did. Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way. I thought it was you. It's the hair! I'm working on that soccer story. Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib. Habib? My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care. I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series? Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park. It's working. Where is he? Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before. I can believe that. Where do you live? Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much. So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night? I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know. After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while. Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you. What kind of people? Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once. Really? He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out. What did you do? I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him. That's really something. Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out. The moon? The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon. Why did you come tonight? To see me? To hear them read Torah. I thought you hated Torah. That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it. Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking. Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie. I don't think Evan gets to be in it -- Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham! I thought I was the bad guy! You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff. Do what? Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise.... You want me to move? Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood. We have to call the ambulance. Why? Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think. What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not? ... Just give me time to think... Pretty low all around. We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around. Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows. Why me? You want to kill a Jew. I already did. The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene -- -- who's married to -- Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back -- -- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't -- And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy -- -- who is the most competitive woman in the world -- Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view. What view? It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name. Or her figger. No more water, you said. Take it. No. Take it, damn it. No. Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water. All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are. I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. Beautiful view, isn't it? Walter, there's something I have to tell you -- What are you DOING here ? I work here, remember ? That was eleven years ago. Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ? Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week. That's a shame. Yeah a real shame. Well, I'll see you at the next staff party. Bye.... When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning? You've heard this story before? So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me. Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is   You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself. You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket. My ticket? I found it on the seat. Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket. Give me your gun... ...<u>what</u>...? What about the porters? Porters? Didn't you find out anything about the porters? Why - I'm sorry - but I  We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today. There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us? Well, we could-- There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans. How's Jonah taking it? It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife -- You're kidding -- Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.

Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by. How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention? Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd. If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd? Thanks. That was good, that crow sound. Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation? I don't know. Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued. Frost? Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know? It's pretty. I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers! Cheers. You look as if you could. Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday? You don't look eighty. That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious. That's a nice teapot. Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals? Don't you think you should call a backup? No, we can handle this. What did you call me? Pardon? What did you call me, boy? I called you Sarge. Before that. I didn't call you anything before that. You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy? No. No, sir! No, sir. Lauder, Sweet Pea! No, sir! Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer? No, sir. Where are you from, boy? Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer. No, sir. Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on! I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door. I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so. Let my kid go. I'm not lettin' no one go. Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table! Don't you fuckin' give orders to me... Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in. I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant. Yeah? I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight. You're kidding. Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word. What? Incurable. Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone. Oh it does??? Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously. Why do you say that? I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman. Hey, I was just trying to ... I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal. Hey, I don't play that. Feels like warm apple pie, dude. Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade? Alright... take it down. What? This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it. Spare me. Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck. You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again? Forget it. Do I know you? I don't know. But they'll put me in jail. Really. Just put it there, Harold. Fuck you. Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around. I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you? Can I ask you something? What? What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties? If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him. Hi, beautiful. Jesus!  Don't do that! Sorry, babe. Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon? Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>! Are you okay? I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here. It's going to be okay. You work here, Keith? Yes. Even Rene? She's the toughest to read. Maybe she's telling the truth. Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know. Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct... The prom. That's funny. Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man? Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets. Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight. No no no no no no no no no... Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes... Thank you. Have a nice day. Look.  I want to see you again. Are you asking me for a date or an appointment? I don't know. If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I -- Forget I asked.  It was a mistake. ... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it. You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material? Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to? I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. That's really funny. I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women. Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through? Three ways? Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle? Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'. Hey! That was a 3k machine. Told you to hide it. Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear? Yeah. How was she? Fabulous. Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers? That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know? Nick? Yeah? This has been a real confusing day. Good hundred yards, I'd say. They'll come out after us. Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped. Hey, Eve! Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain? Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that. Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight? I certainly do! Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think? No it's not! Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean... Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left! Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something-- Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend. Well...yeah. Okay. No advice. Just whiskey. Easy. Easy, boy. All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold. Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter, Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights. I don't think I know that name. -- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation. I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact. I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant? You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk. Sit down. I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you. I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry. Why' would be enough for me. I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry. And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it. Why not? It was just money. And Danny Zorn, what was that? Had to be done. No good options left? In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are. No. You lost your way. Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is. Well, good evening. Good evening. This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me. It won't.  As long as I'm here. The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to. Really? I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen... Gerron. No, straight up. Ouch! Oh! Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different. No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you. Okay.  I'll give it a try. No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try. Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood. Forget it, man.  It's not worth it. Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya... Look? Out of the way, John! No!  Don't kill him! It, John.  Not him.  It. Alright, it!  We need it! Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril? No.  It's unhealthy. ... I Bet you're gay. No, I'm not. Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you -- Never happened! Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day. Yeah? And if she was ugly? Are you going to plead insanity? I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed. Don't talk about my wife. I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends! Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you. But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that. Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back. Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee... Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest. I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish... I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you? Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column. Jesus, Lindsey-- Bud, something really important is happening here. Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria-- Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical! I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew... That's not quite what I said -- It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something... Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you? Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo. Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing Climb off me, will you! And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes. Taylor.	I'm telling you -- Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste? If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts. Gifts? Three, four oxen... much wampum. Wampum? Yes. Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea? Yes. Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen. Amy, not that old tree! Yes, daddy. But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox. I didn't forget. But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox. When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!! But George, I like to push the boundaries... And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care! You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke? Here, Mom. What went wrong? Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be. No. Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room. Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us. They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd. Am I suppose to be this sore? For the first time, yes. It'll pass. _Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist? And you are? Who do you think it is? The Chancellor's here? Now? Evidently.  Coming! Sit down. What are you talking about? Sit down! All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize. I'm going to apologize to Bubber? I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante... Lie, you mean... Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent. I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake. Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him! Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said... They wouldn't be a bit surprised.. <u>What did you do to me</u>? What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason? I don't know. They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you? I know you've been trying to kill me. Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble. So now you know. So it's time to go home. That's all I get? We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that. I don't think so. We have to go home, Jason. Jason Bourne is dead. <u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you... Keep it. Jason...  They can't let you go... That'll be their second worst mistake. I'm in town for a short time. Try? Of course! It ain't even three years we been married. Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good. You called me to ask me how to get laid? What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number. Just dial 976-Asshole. Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know. Have you ever heard of the bible? What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible? Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that. Does it tell me how to get laid? You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready. Ready for what? Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party. The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo- -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it- -now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so- Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea. If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it? There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now. You're what? I am better. Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time. Frank. Frankie. Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake? I... they look both the same. The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit. Dolphins.  Great. It's ecstasy, Sal. Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see! Donde vamos? [Where are we going?] A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it. Senora, anything it costs, I can work-- Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors. So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled. You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation. Is that all? I've got enough on my mind without that. If you say so.  The stripe. Good choice. Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards. Eighteen yards.  That's my house there. C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't-- I need to see his habitat. What do you mean? To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding. Why? Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business. In the Pacific Ocean. It is an island. American territory. Where is Alsace? I do not know, Holiness. You made us what we are, didn't you? Stop her Louis! DID YOU DO IT TO ME???? You fainted. Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . . Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her. She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you. There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention. I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times. We need to talk. Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review... I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise. Hello? I'm not... <i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad. Where is the money? I don't know. I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is. You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.  Mr. Schuyler . Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith. Is that so? That's so. I can't beat a Triumph. You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up. Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for? What, Doctor? A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing... I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important. You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man. Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world. I'm always alone -- I have been everything. Everything? I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything. Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait. There's a charming thought. It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now. If he was able, what would he say. Time to go for a walk, Jake. My mother died in this canyon. Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three... No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist. Welcome to Eureka. Hi. Hi, is Vada home? Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone. Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J. Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days. Will you tell her I came by? Sure. Thank you. Bye. Bye. I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee. I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid? And dost thou live to ask it? My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them. In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom. There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her. What are you supposed to do? Kill the Governor. Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look? Beautiful. Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say. The Tooth... I know... We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all. Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go. I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you? Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor. You can't believe how much he's improved. How many times have you shocked him tonight? Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours. What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator? That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it? A medical miracle. Regan, why are you reading that? Cause I like it. It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature. I wouldn't talk. Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there. Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to? I need this one. Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day? I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school. Dude. What are you doing here? I was hoping Sid and I could talk. You got a comb? Don't need a comb. Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess. Why do you want a room here? Do you smoke? Well, when are you quitting? Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting. Anyone else want one? Rolfe? No thanks. I don't drink. Yeah. I forgot. Hey, bud. Frank... OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet. I'll help ya. Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble. Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable. What do you want from me? At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table... I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but... Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy. Tell him to look through it. Get it. Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob? It's lonely in there, in my room. My name is... Where?  Here? Here. There? Here. Here. Feel anything? No. Everybody has a past. What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing? A bonfire, probably. :I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old. :Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man! What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure. I hope so. What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball? Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket. What? They require a tie and jacket but we have some available. Go, join them. What kind of friend do you think I am? The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it. Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I? Go. I command you. Yes, my lord. We lost our key. Where did you lose it? Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem. Really? Who's your P.O.? Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?! How the fuck should I know!! -- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter. Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard? What is it? Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall. There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual. Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I -- Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here. Hey, Jacques... No "Jacques". I am the Great Went. I am The Muffin. And what a muffin you have. Someone better tell Mac. Why bother? What are you doing? Making our very own solstice fire. Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more... But why, Claudia?... Why? Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea. Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark. You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore. What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom. Maybe they have to pee. Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you? I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay? They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something. Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian. Did we? What did you call me? Pardon? What did you call me, boy? I called you Sarge. Before that. I didn't call you anything before that. You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy? No. No, sir! No, sir. Lauder, Sweet Pea! No, sir! Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer? No, sir. Where are you from, boy? Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer. No, sir. Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on! Pop! Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages? Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call. I thought I told you to lose this guy. Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but... I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;. I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows. You're still asking me to break the law. I'll come to you tonight. No, the children sleep with me. Give them to Refugio. No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too. Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ... Now how's your memory doin'? Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about. Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think. I don't give a shit who you ask. What's your name, boy? Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir! How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo? Not exactly, sir. You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder? Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more. I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely. Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand. Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close. Another man?" Who? It's been a while. This was my very first slow dance. To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire -- ...a poker... he took a poker from the fire... I don't see any. Funny. Funny...   I better go to bed. What do you like to drink? I'm a fiend for mojitas. Tell me.  Please. That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear. Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK. That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore. Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out. I only did it once and... Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes! That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed. Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane? That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you -- But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape... Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray". What? You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster! I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne. A which? You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin. If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me. But... How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us? That's what we're here to find out. If it happened to him, then it could... At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I - I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements. The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you! You willing to b-back that up with odds? Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up. I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy! It was the Terrance and Phllip movie! How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing. Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to... I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah. I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse. And you're worried about him. I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas. Yes, this is Doctor Marrow. How'd I know it was for you? Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you. You are very good in the world history class, yes? Me? We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral. Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry? So lemme see it. Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here. That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right? Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back. Comrade Buljanoff... Comrade. Comrade Kopalski... Comrade. What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade. Hey look, it's our teacher. Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here. Up here, Boss. That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately. But from now on it's Lucky's spot. Not my arm! What you fucking want? I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why. Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way. Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station. What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on. I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details. They're big details, Jerry. Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater. A water main broke. They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated! Okay, I will. You will? If that's what you want.  Yes. No luck? Next time, date only basketball players. Where the hell have you been...?  It's... Sherry, this... I lost the touch The touch? The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean? Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben. We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here. Yeah. Good. There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it. That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family. I know. Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch. Tell me about it. He was just doing his job. So was I. Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard. Sorry. I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name? Joad. Tom Joad. How many of you? Anybody know about this? I didn't even know about it. Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like? I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us. I'd love to. How'd it go? Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads. You guys have fun? Game six is history,pal. You're not making sense. Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too. You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together... No... before that. Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college. Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight... Then this is our chance. Our chance to do what? I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy. What the fuck are you doing? Coming with you. You will not live to see the morning. Why are you doing this? No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you... What is it, officers? My patient is waiting. Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader? Bird books mostly... It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide. If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back? You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true. Yeah, we're closed. So go away. Actually we have something for you. Then, this is what it would sound like underwater? Yes, sir. When were you in Niagara Falls? About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop. Now, is your shit together? Forever together. I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence. It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside. Hey, man, how's it going? Hi, Auggie. Sweetheart, write down your former address. What? Write down Drexl's address. Why? So I can go over there and pick up your things. No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there. It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye. No, a major, were you really? Heard of Harry Lime? I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him. Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job... Did you clear this? With who? They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied? Communicated with us <U>how</U>? But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him. He'll never let us go. You're not telling us something. Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here. You were saying... Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again. What? The spiders. Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists? On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game. John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm? My wife is the game player in the family, sir. Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me. Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-... ...-ful?! Okay.  Okay. Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable -- Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like -- I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there. enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are Get oacK on their tail. Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat. Then it happened before they scuttled her. It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop? Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis... They stop for nothing. But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  -- Nothing. It's not. No. Never heard from him again? Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town. It's for Ann . . . Oh, how nice! Thank you very much. Flowers. I'm terribly sorry she isn't here. She isn't? No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house. Oh! Did you want to see her about something important? Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the  Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal? I understand the <i>business</i> reasons. Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past. You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one... It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler. They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you. Those aren't the facts that matter. You're getting off the grift? That's right. That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know. I don't? If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age? I don't see why not. Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him. A blister shore can hurt. Yeah. Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that. Me, too. How ya doin', Mookie? Whaddup? Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother. Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego. My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible. The district attorney's office will comply provided - No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity. May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here. Immunity. And then, there's Richard's Burrito. What's that? That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland. I	know what a burrito is. Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other. What's inside? You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes So you think time travel is possible? For people? Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants. Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise? Okay. I promise. This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years. You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me. Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan? Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper. She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her? I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual? Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off. You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere! I notice you still remember it. I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you. You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it. Done what? Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted. Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for. Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change. I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker. Now, that's a nice thing to say. Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works? Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry. A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it. Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up. What home? I embellished. Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."? I embroidered. ...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"? I lied. Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck... Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works? Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct. Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct. Vincent? Yes, Max? Am I collateral? Yeah. What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something? Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip. Lingerie... Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right? Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT Looks like you're the one might go to pieces. Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here! How did she die?  I wanna know. You don't wanna know. Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think. She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night. Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character. I wish he was.  He's real enough. Morning, Sunshine... Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed. At least he didn't swing with your ride. No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying? Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this. NO... no... I said leave her alone. Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform? You mean hiding them? Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show! What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body. Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?

You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single. What does he do? He's an organic farmer. Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice. Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight. Where's the drop? You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where.

We still are. And we've loved every minute of it. That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich? Can I help you? I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat. Well, what did you want? You have any biscuits for sale? Naw, we don't have biscuits. On the handlebars or your shoulders? Are you afraid of heights? Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static! Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke? I advise you to let us go. You advise us! You're out numbered son. I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us. The police are very busy. I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded. You're glad somebody tried to kill me? No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out... Yeah, like... Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic. It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it. Well, it shattered your faith in everything. I'm just temporarily off my game. You need to believe in something besides yourself. I believe in you. The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago! And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this? See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right? I leave it to you. My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky. Twinky? Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"... Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time... That's a wig you wear, isn't it? A wig? Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front. Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you? He's my father. Your father? There's more.

It's just that you look troubled that's all... Yeah well, it's been a bad day. A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul. Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns? They're not guns.  They're particle throwers. Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em. I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone. Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape. That's not your tape. Then where did you get this not my tape. THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE. Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.

Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles. What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange. What else did he say, Jake? A grand scheme? A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see? No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that! Can't we move any faster? Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next! What? Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean. What is this? So uh...

Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks. But, you know, so what? Are you proposing marriage to me? Yes? You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck. What do you mean? We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage. I don't understand. Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down? On the floor? Yes, on the floor. This is a good suit. I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down. Alright. Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought-- I know. Is it a star? It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good. Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question? He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it? Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants. What?! I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture. From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you. Do you think I... Danny, please, we don't want to know. You admit you're lying? I admit I don't know where he is. You're the first one he'll contact. He's got my number. I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister... Okay. She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus. Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids-- No, I know that part -- So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B -- No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice -- A sense of humor. I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him. Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie. No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him. You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle -- Poor Phillippe! The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice? All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal. Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it? No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!! Naw, you pull it! We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you. I'm wid it. I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing. Go on.  Good so far. I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw? All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay. And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for... Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer? Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who? No shortage of suspects. The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.? Is it true? Wallace is captured? Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation. When will his trial be? Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed. Now tell me you love me. Lemme down, bugface! That's not even close. Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.

Sorry. Happy Birthday, Nicholas. I'll call.  I really will. I know. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. My fault. You're not hurt, are you? I don't think so. I wish you'd make sure. Why? Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars. Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. Thank you. Who are you? Now, really - Mmhmmm... knap... sap... What's he saying? I'm Crash Davis. Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance? I don't dance.

Otherwise, you risk killing him. This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself. I just don't believe that! You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow -- Such as? What a waste of lives and opportunities and -- Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it? What? You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right? Oh, yeah. What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say. I'm not leaving. We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis... I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives. But, Mr. President... So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover. Oh, right, sorry. Okay, let's go. What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal? Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing. What did ya do? I'm a robber. You're a bank robber? Nope.  I've never robbed a bank. What? Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it. How? Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I... No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what? Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal. Tell me. Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in... Well that's good. But you never came across just one. So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters. And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece. You're out of your mind. What's your point? I will do no such thing. Yes, you will, Mr. Watson. Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to? I need this one. Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day? I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school. -- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya. Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel. I'm working on it. Bag this fucker Buzzy. It's gettin' done Sid. So that was why she tried to run away. Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here? I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go. Hold on. We can't stay here! It's a long walk back to Aspen. ...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me? Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move. We can't leave the piano Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased.... --no-- --can we use their names?-- Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted. I don't want to...I have scary dreams. Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started. I'll be here. Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's? God, it's so totally pathetic. You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too. Why the fuck would I do that? O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight? The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and- -and Babcock, I remember. Now go on! Now that's just gross. GO, GO, GO! How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean? Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half... Then we're all in on it? Everybody but Joey, and you know who. Where are they? You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with. Where are they? Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police... You leave me no choice. Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them? I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them. That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you! What's that? The fucking New York Times. What the fuck! The paint! Boss! Jesus! They've -- They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT! What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and... Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool. Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years! I don't want to talk about it here, Brad. Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one. Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon? No. The last one, please. I'm gonna kick his ass! I'm gonna help you. Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad? Sure. As long as she don't mind. There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him. Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'. I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy. I'm not interested yet. I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him... That's what you said? Something witty and devastating like that. In the kitchen, under the sink. No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed. On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it? That's me, Sir. Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying. If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes. Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant? Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter. Warm. Is it? Now get on with it. We were going to do it. Aye, well, now! Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money. It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study. Well he asked me for it! I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish. Talk ta me, Bork. Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived. Did you give him a full cavity search? Ah, the witness? Yes. You can never be too careful Bork. Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look. He's pretty! Okay!  I wasn't sure You've left unfinished business before. Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment. What are you doing, boy? Getting Pearl to bed. I -- What's taking you so long about it? It -- she -- What's that you're playing with, boy? Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward. Come on, children! Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book... But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba... Three business days.  They mean three business days. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. I don't understand. That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out. Bad boy.... I didn't do it on purpose.... At the mercy of a mad pilot. We'd be eternally grateful if you  What did he say? He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster. Roger? Rockin'! Scotty? Homework? I finished that. I'm just messing around. Tanks, huh? You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive. So you're going into the Army? You think that <u>is</u> the truth. I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real. And what do you believe? I don't understand. Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog! This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it? Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high. I didn't bring any  -- Eddie, you've got to get me out of here. Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are. But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her! Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately. Like what? Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead. You son-of-a-bitch! Oh Jesus... He killed her...he killed her... What happened?  What's Earl doing here? He found us, he shot her...he killed her... Booth, listen to me...Booth! He killed her... We have to go. No, wait! At least stay for dinner! Is your name Paul Benjamin? What can I do for you? I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all. How the hell did you get into the building? What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think? The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game? I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas. Thomas? Who's Thomas? Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister. I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas. Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew. You mean Rashid? Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was? Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since. And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what? Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now! I just want to know where he is. As far as I know, he went back to his parents. His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents? That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street. I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects. He doesn't go to the Trinity School? He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn. And his parents? His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years. I shouldn't have let him go. Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place? I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now. He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is. Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water? No thank you. Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected? Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill. And you told your nephew about it? I figured he had a right to know. And? And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead. Those are pretty hostile words. The airport? Why? Are you leaving? Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy. I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them. I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to. So - why the airport? I work in the immigration department there. Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead? V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator. It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything. Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony? Yes. Do they know he tell you things? Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt. Charming. Julie? I'm right here. Grab my hand. How do you like your bath, sir? I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath? Yeah, that'd bring you back to life. You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys. Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this. It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later. Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie. There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair. Another dozen out back. They gonna rush us? They're just insurance in case we run. Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise. A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad? Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth... It was a veal stock, I thi... Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones... What'd you do? I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away. Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger. Go on, Willie. ...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things. Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval? The pleasure is mine, madame. Who are you? It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything-- You're the flower lady. Um...yes. I've seen you.  From the window. Is everything alright? Mac... let's get out of here. Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it. I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS. You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight. ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN? WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress? Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two. For the money, they re hands down the best radial we carry... Okay, I ll take them... You won t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume... Oh... Hi. Dirty business we're in sometimes. Yeah. He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do. No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same. I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart -- Why, Walter, you're getting poetic! You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands! -- Burn them. And old ladies? -- Burn them. And the world -- the whole world. -- Burn it all. Erin, you've been gone for a week. I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and -- That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off. Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention. I'm going to hit you. I don't know. Are we gonna split up? No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I? We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly. I can cry on cue. Is THAT Odin? You'll have to wait till he's finished his game. Odin! Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding. Yes. Do you mind me cussin', boy? No. Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all... Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE? Those are my breasts. Can I feel 'em? If you want to. Well! Nothing like experimenting. I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to. No touch. No touch. No touch. You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me. Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black. Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party! I'm in love with Libbets Casey. Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets. It's beyond mere physical attraction. That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act. Truly? Do speak. My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her! How do you know this shit? They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad? You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here? Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him? Good thinking Marge. He's adorable! Adorable! I'm a very patient man. That's great.  Good for you. Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know? Could you be a little more specific? How did you get this number? Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you. I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that. I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it. ...Why? You shouldn't have taken the money... I need the Wayne Diamonds. We gonna trap ourselves a snowman? Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator. Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again. Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed. I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me? Alright. Let's talk business. Why not? What's the best thing I can see tonight? Me. Okay. Hi. So who's the lucky guy? Who? The groom? Shoes, Hats.... The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol. You're bleeding. I'm all right... You're wastin' your time. No more games. I object, your Honor... Overruled... Exception! Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed... Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that? Ten days ago. Do you know how she found the apartment? Through a rental agency. Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also? You gave them a fresh taste of blood! They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it! Rick, I want to talk to you. Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service. Yeah, this is better than rape. Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo. Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter... Why are you here, then? Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott -- Abbott? He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris... So when was I here? What do you mean? For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When? No. You never worked Berlin. My first job. Your first assignment was Geneva. That's a lie! You never worked Berlin... How is it? Not good. Do you have a back up. It's video. Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen! You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it? His face. Does he have hair? Yes. Is it long and hanging down? I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like. But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said? Go on to the next question. That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences! Fisher, let him talk. But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be. I like that. Whatta ya mean, Boss? Ya piss like a man. And the bookstore? Have you been working there long? It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation. Your dissertation? What subject do you study? American literature. What else? What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis? Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction. Wow. You don't fool around, do you? Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities? Melville, huh?  It's been a while. That's the subject of my last chapter. Not an easy book. Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life. You guys having a go a me or what? We're only joking.....It is your round though! Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it. Last night. You have a good time? That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will. No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way. Hello. Hello. What'd she die of? She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*... What was she afraid of? Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things... Yeah, I guess. She plays the clarinet, too. Where is he? I don't know. It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge. What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope? I'm up.  Thanks. Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me. Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley? He was a President. President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up. Really.  What'll I pin this on? Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own. Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner! Ok... You intended to bring your reserves across the river? I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left. Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out! No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry. Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend? What's your shoe size? What?  Who are you? Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off. Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one? Land of the free. Home of the brave. You want us to fire a shot if... No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side. You, please. Me? Yes. Could you give me some information? Gladly. How long do we have to wait here? Well -- until the policeman whistles again. At what intervals does he whistle? What? How many minutes between the first and second whistle? That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before. Have you never been caught in a similar situation? Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles. In other words you don't know. No. Thank you. You're welcome. I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some. There's no sin in charity, Jeanne. They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small. Whose were they? My father's. I'm sure he'll forgive you. He already did, but I want God to forgive me too. Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church. Is that bad? Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home? Oh yes... very. And your mother -- everything's fine with her? Oh yes, she's... wonderful. Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening! Neo, this has to be done! Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it? What are you talking about? The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me... I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone. The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God. Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work. What do you want from me? Something I guess I can't have anymore. Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again. You think I didn't need you? If you did, you never showed it. Ronnie... She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice. Spoken words? No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words. What are they? Want me to breathe deeply? Just breathe normally. Do you know who did this? Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing. Think Eddie had something to do with it? Doesn't look good. Where you been all day? At school. It's Thursday. Oh, I forgot. Kelly's next, Gloria. Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me. Quiet, Mollie, quiet! Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about. How'd you get here, Earl? Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie? What's the matter? How can you ask me that? You're making me feel guilty again. You are guilty. I'm guilty. Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta. I know what I know. And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again? He didn't come! I'm here! You're late! We're here. Got your ticket? No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake. Yo. Damone. It's Mark. Mark. What happened to your date? It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home. Did you go home and get it? No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here? You okay? Sure. Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French..... Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference. Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here. Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something. Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster. My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment. And the experiment is in here? Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55 Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather. You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it. Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech! Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right? Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period. I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period! Ah, you know people there? I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death. Pop, stop lying. Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you? Sorry I-- It's okay. You need me? Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores. Armed. Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck. Thanks. Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop. The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables? But she just got here... She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat... What did you expect - live sables? A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people... How come you didn't let him shoot me? Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you. We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks. I don't know, sir. One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I? Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain. Brother, I hear you talkin'. What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost. Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have. Good evening, Baxter. Hi, Doc.  Had a late call? Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick. Oh.  'Bye, Doc. Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys. Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink. As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night. I'm sorry if it gets noisy -- Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you! Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ... I'll make it short. Sorry.  It's your baby now. I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together. I'm all tied up.  I can't. Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town. What has Artie to do with it. We're engaged. Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town. I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place. It's just impossible. Nobody can be that busy. But you told us to starve. Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben -- Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side. And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya. I'll take him anyway. Why? Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him. My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth? I have told the truth. You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir. They're from good stock on their mother's side. Thank you. I am... I did slave all day. And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House! You should have left here years ago, like I did. It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust. After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious. Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently. Wouldn't we all. Jesus, I told you to watch it! Sorry. Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party... I thought you were going to be late- When I'm guest of honor? I had no idea you were even here. I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing. That never stopped you before. Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested... She's a girl of so many interests. It's a pretty rare quality these days. She's a girl of so many rare qualities. So she seems. So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair... It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away. You don't think we're going to make it. I didn't say that. You didn't have to......... I just need you to be safe. What about you? What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe. How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States? That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying? To protect his people. I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him. Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you. John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard. Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police! What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag? I don't think you're very polite. Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;. This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon. Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth. Thank you, Captain. Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets? I'm fucking out of here. Lawford? Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks. Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene. Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system. Precisely what you're paid to prevent. Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password? What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman. You were twanging too loud. Here's a towel. Thanks. What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills. Is that what it is? You're damn right that's what it is. That ought to be about the end of that. Yup. You killed him. Oh, yes. She said peanuts, you cretin. You never know around here. So what year are you going into? Junior. Got a boyfriend back home? No. Why not? I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies. You a lesbo? No. Who'd ever think, to look at you? As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you. You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call? We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me. I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot. It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413. Oh, stop it! The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something. I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ... Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late? Too late? That's for me to say. Well ... well, I ... - well? What happened? Nothing much. She apologized. Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ? How ya doing? It stinks, you goin. I don't stay where I'm not wanted. If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo. Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it. What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name? Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet. Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you. Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest? Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin? Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee -- He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well. I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill. Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head. You gotta promise to feed her. I will. Fresh goat's milk. Absolutely! According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed. Yeah? So? Is that my problem? It's everybody's problem! Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated. That's what I am to you? A contract? You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot. I'm staying. FINE. So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...? Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there. I'll send a cab. Here is my card. This is the Nexus? For you. This is where you wanted to be. But I never had a wife, children, a home like this. Enjoy them, Jean-Luc. Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out? I'm going to talk to you. Right. Come on. Where? Away from here. This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most. I'm getting really tired of your bullshit. My what? You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly. You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation? I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things! Okay fine. Fine? Fine what? Whatever you say Kojak. I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money. What about Luther? What about Ganz? Yes, of course    but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream. He was a kind little man in his way    and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it. Drink your milk. Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred? Fred? -- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine. I want you back too, Viktor. Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here? No! Mom, they're in a cage! They're birds! Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open. Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred. Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball. Sure, I'll take her up right now. And why is that? Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him. I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm. An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways. And have you mended them? I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape. You named the kid after yourself, huh? That boy's one in a million. A real tiger. So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school. Uh-huh. Any idea where I might start looking? She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then. All you want is a phone number? Well, I know you're busy... Don't play games with me, Ted. I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador. I don't buy it. You don't buy what? So you ever gonna do a picture? Not you too It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great. I wonder sometimes. You're just scared. Am I? You callin' me a thief, my man? No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask. And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief? I don't know? Oh.  I... where's Louise? She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend. That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely. McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had. Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how. I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close. I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone. Like hell you do. Dick, don't push me right now. Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it! Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow. Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can. She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight. Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now. ...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district -- -- Go on! We actually got a phone call. Busy morning. Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard? Four or five days ago. Why? Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love. I hope that's the cousin. Maybe it's the wrong ship. Shut up! You're it. Am not. Are, too. D2. What is it, David Lee? Listen, Mama... And what's the occasion of this celebration? It's my birthday. And how many people will be attending this birthday party? I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us. Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go-- Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble. And what are you, his chaperone? Actually, I'm his father. Are you <u>real</u> mad? How could I be?  We learned some magic... We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you -- How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection. Helena -- Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back. Everything okay, David? Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to. He's just parking the Governor's car. Great - keep him out of trouble. Zavitz, what? You want your old job back? Listen to me-- Tired of chasing squirrels around the park? Listen-- Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking-- Turn on CNN. They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on-- Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN! Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so-- Do it! You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life. Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect -- Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie. I know. The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income. You being audited? For the last four years. My firm'll represent you. Free of charge. You don't work there anymore, Bobby. That's temporary. Bullshit. Rachel-- We're screwed. I'm gonna fix it. How? Tell me about Brill. Ted!  What are you...? I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight. Katrina... Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality? Just how serious is it, doctor? Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever. Oh, gosh. You got it. Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so -- Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us? Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play? I didn't have the time. Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike. Mind if I cut in? No, not at all. You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time. No, please. Sit down then. We often have a double up here. I see. Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit. Ethan, tell me - As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince. Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again? Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird? Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation? Charming. More delightful people crippled. Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on. Meaning what? That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it. Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for.. Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight.. Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..! I can give myself a headache instantly. Is that like a party trick? All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits. Stay here. Be careful -- there're two of them. Neo! What the hell just happened? An Agent!  You have to send me back! I can't! The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed. True.  But why? The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding? Nothing. Where are the stockings he strangled them with? How did you know they were stockings? I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot. You can help us. What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down. Forget Tonya Randall. I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me. Then prove her wrong. I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me. So you're gonna act salty all night? Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year. What happened to Cole? He retired. Where? Upstate. Upstate where? Atascadero. That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it? Mother and son. You arranged this...? I thought it might begin the healing process. All right, we'll call it a draw. Come, Patsy. You okay? How do I look? Aces. This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world. Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine. Can you read 'em Jack? They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it. The country boy's about due. Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified. Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next. What's that? Denning was wearing a bug. You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked. I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France. You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours? At home. I couldn't face all this traffic. I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive? It's just us now. I know. What can I get for you tonight. How about your phone number? I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose. And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing? Somebody hit you? It's not what you think. Are you alright? Pigsty. Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better. Pig died. Who the fuck's Pig? My dad died.  My dad, my dad. Donna's gonna be angry about her cat. Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole. You sound real remorseful. Get him out of here! Here, Lester. It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher - If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to - What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen? Willie Mays. You mind if I check things back here? It's fine. I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back. You are the younger of two... Can I ask you something, Kittridge? Certainly Ethan. If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse? I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me? Julius! Dr. J.! That's not -- You interested in a little work? Torch them!! But... He's gone already!  Do it! I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week. Liar! Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals... Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on! You got the money? Right here. Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it. Well, that just happened that time. Well, it better not happen again. Mr. Mulder. What happened to Kurtzweil? He's come and gone. What's the matter with you? Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff. What's bluff? That. Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you. No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through. Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head. What you need is some relaxation. Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something. I can understand that -- after your -- uh -- Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm... What do you want with her? I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law. She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry. Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty? Pretty as a picture. Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years. Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight. Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish? Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter. Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms! I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more. Good morning. Horses. You don't forget anything, do you? No. --how old? I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume. Then there she blows. You're pretty funny, Mayo. Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am... She married some English prick. He's not that bad of a guy ..? Got a handshake like a partially excited penis. Can I go swimming? No.  Find your brother, okay? I'm okay. I just lost my balance. I put you on the floor. Oh. I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh? Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? I do bite my thumb, sir! Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir. [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay? Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up... If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that! Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape. I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do. Well what are we supposed to do? I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl -- I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall. Define small. Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal. Kings and sixes. That's good. Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee. Nothing. He had two days. Perhaps he is not all he says he is. I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die? Me? No, that door over there. I don't want to die. Are you afraid? Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man. Exactly. Woah. Death. The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini? No. Bob did. Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes. Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry? Anthony, I'm petrified. You're not sore at me? What for? For  not being any help? I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College. To learn to shoot cannon? There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is. That's true. Then there's the other issue. What's that? You need time to think. About the case, about you and me. I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out. And nobody else can do that? Not the way I can. That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around. Don't confuse what we do with who we are. I just need to go a little slow. That bad, huh? We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms.... In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up. This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet. Oh, yes, sir. Vector ? Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed. I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way. Can you at least start wearing a bra? Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat. ...Thanks. Mr. Balboa -- Rocky. Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager? No -- Just me. Rocky, would you be interested in -- Sparrin'? Excuse me. I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available. I'm sure you are. Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what? What? I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner. What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on? Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that -- Thank God this plate was already fixed. Are you alright? I'm fine. What happened? Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here. This be it? Y'all take American Express? Yessir. Then lemme throw in a couple more things. Antidote to what?  Whose disguises? Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten. Planet 10? There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it- You been here the whole time? I just caught the end. You mean he doesn't work for you? No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important. It is--you know what a struggle he's had. Indeed, he has often told me. You really suck, you know that? Just go. Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--? You drink at 10 am, do you? No -- no -- I mean-- I wanna see the picture today That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music-- Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today. He personally asked you to? That's right Colon! Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to! It can't take that long. Why? Ask me what I want to change about this moment. What do you want to change about this moment? Nothing. What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited. In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>? I'll call that little bluff.  How close? Listen!  Listen... ...to him!  You don't know who... ...you're dealin' with! I'm a dangerous man! Yeah, he's a dangerous... ...man! He's crazy! I'm crazy? WHERE IS MR. MERRICK? I... I don't know what you mean, Sir. Paul, I know you've been out. What? You've been out of your room. No, I haven't. Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south. I don't know what you're talking about. O'Neil? How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part? Last time I didn't. Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me... How do you know this place? Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job. Did he get fresh? Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help. What for? And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries. Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you. Father's back?  Still angry? Maybe we should do some exercise. This is all the exercise I need... That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful! Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace. I'm sorry, but they turned down your card. Oh yeah, let me give you another card. Okay, thanks. But I.. Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember? Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down. You ain't going in alone? That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living .. I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him. Yes, papa. Let's make us even, shall we? Even? And video games after! Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"? Charlie, this is Bob. Bob   Charlie Brown. Hi, Charlie. Shirelles. You know that song? It's not over, Brynner. Sir, we can't just let him get away with this! Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off. All right, let's move... That Dave? The things a girl has to put up with. What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share? I... I... You're so sweet. If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup. Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens. Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours. Will you pardon me? <U>Gladly</U>. Not much luggage. I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean. How grateful? Well that depends. On what. How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me? How I usually find you, Nyah. How do you that. Magic... Ahh.. Answer and I'll shoot! You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers. Is there anything else you need? No -- I'm fine.  Thank you. See does he want some. Do you want some food? You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger. Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here. No women allowed. I am an English woman. Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry. Sorry for what? I should have done this a long long time ago. About sixteen hundred. Partners, ain't we? Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. Hello. Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes. Okay. Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number. What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions? They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got. Who gets it, the company? No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could. So where is all them half-centses? They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where. You're a fighter? How you know that? I can tell. I <i>was</i>... -- is that what this is all about? Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks -- Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him. What are you talking about? -- think what you have time to think, Lester. No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother! But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!... I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again! How can I go on? I feel so... responsible. Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen. You think I shouldn't fly. I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man. Would you take me back? Would they? I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men. That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist? He had a mother and father -- and he knew them. One in a million, I suppose Will we always leave it at this? Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it. I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away. Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires. Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew. My husband has convinced me of the contrary. Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty. Even if I weren't. Maria... I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me? Frances? My fianc e. That was some shit, huh? Why'd he have to do that to that girl? Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl. Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle. Bastards took off, though, didn't they? May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia! Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days! Can I see him? Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him. I dunno what I can do to help you? I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there .. What about Citrine? Screw Citrine. He can fire me. Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife. Thank you. You okay? Yeah, I guess so. Really? Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party. No look, really, this isn't nescess ... We must examine you. There's nothing wrong with ... that. Please ... we are doctors. You're awake. Good girl. What happened to me? I'll get the doctor. Wait a moment -- Alors? Alors quoi? Le montage, l emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors  stuff. How much would it cost me? A l achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais  a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don t know any Austrian, Xavier. But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable. Then why don t you reach him? I don t have your credentials, Nathalie. Goodbye Father. I call you. Okay. ...who...? Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting... Mister White is... Snoop onto them... ...as they snoop onto us. I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway. Capt'n! Now what? It's locked? Well... Don't. I know what you're going to say. No, really, Sara, I don't think you -- You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her. I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me. She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby. Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed. We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice. Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name. I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix. Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you? I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows. Really? Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all. No? When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and --- And? And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all. And what do you do -- now? I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail Oh! What a picture -- and what else? I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. That's a silly joke. Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. What is the matter? That was so weak. Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway. It was such a long time ago. Still-- If Ed ever found out.... Or Kat.... And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her. Have you ever thought about my responsibilities? Oh Jack, what are you talking about? Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers? Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word. Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it. Goodbye. What? It's a kiss...  Goodbye... She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies. But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying. But there was nothing, no one in the garden. She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind. Anything but the Jayer Richebourg! She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie. I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out -- She jumped.  She'd been depressed. Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..? PMS. Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?! Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea. What?! First of all -- don't panic! Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl. Girl...?! Reese...you got a first name? Kyle. Kyle, what's it like when you go through time? White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe. Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too. I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little. Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend? How can you bring that up at a time like this? Put that thing back on him, Fergus. He's hot. Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up. I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this. John, he's got my driver's license. What? He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live. He took your wallet? No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license. He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet? In my pocket. We got him!  Dad you got him! What? His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet. How the hell am I gonna do that? Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners. What... Please, Dad, just do it. Okay, okay... This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back! What does he say? Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know! Milo? Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. Have a seat. Why aren't you at work? I mostly work from home. I'm a composer. No shit. Like Johannes Brahms? No, more commercial stuff. Like what? Commercials. Oh. Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant? Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch! I wrote that. You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say? They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home. How's Verdell doing? He's a pain in the ass. Everyone seems so-- Jittery is the word. And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much? I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls. Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is. Oh, he's adorable, Annie. You think so? Do you really? We're going to take them to the airport. Length, 22 feet, 8 inches. Come on, let's check the bite radius. The what? Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth? The whale's mouth? The Shark's mouth. What shark? If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division. Where did you get this? Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me. What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live? This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka. What the hell are dreams, anyway? Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died. I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu. Oh, so you're a warrior then? Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer. What do we do with the Humvee? We leave it. Vodka martini. Two. Shaken not stirred. Well? You leave it. It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for. It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either. Tex? You mean he's here, too? Look. When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high? What the devil -- If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice. Could be a shark.  But maybe not. Look, I know a little bit about sharks. Do you? I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan.... What are you lookin' at? Nothing. Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me? No, all we got is $40. You sure? Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back? Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without-- Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*! Hi Wendy. Hi Stan. I appreciate -- a man as busy as -- That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk? Miss Flaemm. Hello! I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm. Presently, Mr. Preysing. It's urgent. Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command! Aye, sir. But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police -- That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man -- Thanks for reminding me. He'll be atop the portculis ere long. Best get down close to the moat, lad. Aye.  We're good as inside. It's what we'll find there worries me. We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband? He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue. You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens. Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me? We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch. Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there? I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard. There are no stories anymore. Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil. Are you sure? I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will. But... Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me. Okay... Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you. What name? Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it. Why? I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead. Why? I don't know. That's all I was told. How far up the trail? I don't know -- I don't know. Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin? Absolutely. We would be honored. Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately! Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it. Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm? Yeah, you're the worm guy. The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means? No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out. It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent? They don't believe her. Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore. What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me. What! I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room. Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them. I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab. Thanks.  I'll think about it. Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun -- Jesus! You want coffee or something? Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen -- Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think? My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all. Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante... No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest. A quest? But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you. The Little... They work for Him. Him...? God... I'm the janitor of God. Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic! Let me alone. You're crying, Animal. It's that song, Harry! You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it! There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away! There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much. Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks. You paid off thirty grand I never owed. We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out. And what's the price of their not finding out. Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile. Thanks...friend. I found it at an outlet store.  I know it s a knock-off, but I think it ll look great on you... Zeena... I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks. Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...? I could tell you who was last, mister. It's stopped. What? Listen, it's not erasing. You're late. I'm sorry. You were never late before, I was worried. What's he do? He's trying to be an actor. Hear she's retarded. She ain't retarded, she's shy. Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo. Does that bum have to say that? Who's this? Dennis Leary. Leary? No. Lydia? Hello, darling. Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it. Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it. He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was... That sounds great   can you hold on...  What Zoe? We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until... Incredible! Go on. Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways. What's wrong ? I just want to double check the facts. I want to know what in hell you're doing. I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit. I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out -- Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene! -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>? An on-site monitoring well?  That means -- It was right up on the PG&E property over there. And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous? Yeah. Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine. I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list. What are you doing? Nothing. I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink. You don't? No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa-- He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink. Say, listen-- Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch. Do you know what you're doing. Trust me. Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks. He doesn't want my help. That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone. He can handle it. What if he can't? I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel. You mean the nerve. Good morning. What? It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana. How did you do that, Flynn? Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy? Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ... You ever hear about the oranges? You mean, the insurance frammis? Tell me about the oranges, Lilly. The name is Batty.  Roy Batty. Oh? You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection. Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one. So you weren't interested in music at all? Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it? There's got to be a flashlight. I don't understand why they're getting you involved. Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long? All right, Calloway. You win. I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas... I said you win. Win what? I'll be your dumb decoy duck. When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one. There's gotta be a way out of this place... Don't give up on me now, Dean. They'll never stop. I love you. They ruined me tonight. Dean, I love you. Do you hear me? I like sleep. Here he comes. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Hundreds of times. Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around. Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay. Why, yes. This is amazing. If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself. Oh, wonderful! Snake - what is it? How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city. MOMMY! Mommy's here. Baby wants to fuck. What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want. I need money. What for? You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money. Do you have the blood test? You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me? Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another Oh, Superman! Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin! He can have mine. Anytime. What? Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream. Oh yeah ... But -- are you sure? We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother. Michelle cannot possibly accept! She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet. Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ? Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that. Die?  What...? I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge. Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No. It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you. Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken -- We can't shoot in the Old Mill. I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we... It burnt down. The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink? I think I will. Admiral. Full power is restored. Thank you, Spock. I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg. Fuck you. You don't think I've got it to give? No! Back to San Francisco. Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh? There's really very little point in my trying to explain. I buy that. What about him? He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS. LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales. We don't want to be any trouble. You've already been that. C'mon. What's the matter? Nothing. What'd I say? Nothing. You're upset. I'm not upset. All I said was you were good. Look. You don't know good. All right? What's that supposed to mean? It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you. You were good. Let's make a deal.  You shut up. You were good. How do you know? Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit! What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around. Theo rode for this place a long time, man. Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily? I think it's like... inquisitive. It was Henry Follett. Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is. What do you want to know? You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything. I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir. No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years. Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats. So you pay off our customs officials? In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult. Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you. But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied. Not the way to talk to people. Can I do anything I want? No. But, I am in charge. Are you? Of whom? I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God. So help me God. Senator, you can talk all you want to, now. He <u>has</u> to know... Everybody knows about-- What's this? See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job. What are you afraid of?  Turn it on. Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on. Do you expect me to believe you? Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up... You go first. Let me watch how to do this. You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you. From where?  D.C.? Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon. Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four! Who cares? I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire-- The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka. Of course they did. Let the buyer beware. What do you say, Dodge? Did you ever eat fish heads and rice? Of course not. You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero? Folks came. Folks come. Folks go. Here, let me carry that. You're implying that I planted a gun? Not at all -- Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake! Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...! Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face? It was me. - end where I began. Maude. Yes. Here. You can count on the truth from people who don't like you. You have a helluva way of asking for help. You have a helluva way of answering. John... Sshhh... Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know. Of course not. It would just be helpful to know. No. Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different. I'm just preoccupied. Do you like my new look? Yeah. It's nice. It's really good. I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want. Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want. Really? Sure. Of course. Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis. That's great. I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl! Not even a little bit? I already told you I'm not. When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room... Um... Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you... Listen to me.  Hear the words. This is madness! It is the truth. No! You rigged the illusion to fail, right? Yes. You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes? Yes. And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann I tried to pay you off. Was that Swann's idea? No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after. Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake. Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter? What'd you find out? The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual -- Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang? It was stolen. They are dead.  In either case -- We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately. It makes me fear her. I can't understand that. It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful. Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out. I don't need pills... just sleep. Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual. You talk to the married couple? Not yet. What kind of backup do we have? <u>We</u>? How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox? Long as Charlie says. I can always flush you down the toilet. Keep thinking. I have been... I think you're right. About what? Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here. Rene? She works for them. Now, you're too suspicious. You were the one who was always suspicious of her! I was wrong. She tried to help us get away. No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along. No -- Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite -- At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but... Sir? Yes, Hicks? Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks. What's the question? Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt? All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved. Take any one ya like. Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs. A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents. Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now. I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb... ... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little. Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!? Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans. That's right, I know.  I fucking know. Know what? Open the case! All right!  Where's the key? You don't need a key. Sugai won't give it to me, you know that. Then take it from him. I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office. How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell? Scared. We're scared. Got a smoke? You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake. The name's Plissken. Sir, if the subs haven't left by now... They've left, keep watching! Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening. It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE? Yes, that's right. You okay? Yeah. I'm sorry about what I said. Said what? About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian? Forget it. I'm sorry. I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know? Well, is it? What? Parked outside? No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you. Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach? That's it! I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you -- No one can take my father's place. He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him. This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire. Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding. Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on? I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS... JTS...? What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet. I'm in a kind of...underground...thing. Are you an artist? No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private. Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give. Uh-huh. Her life is in your hands. Oh, man, don't say that.. Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands. Shit. Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done. Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions.. In other words, you're calling her a flake. Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he? Nice. Boys, we're home free. Can't do what? We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car. You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you. Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you. Where are you? Takin' care o' business, honey. Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight. You know I hadda meet some people tonight -- Thanks for handling this. Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you. Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you. Name's Duff. How 'you doing? Okay. Looks like you're doin' a good job. Thanks. Don't say much, do you? Guess I don't. Just so you do your work. Betty Elms? Yes. I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you. Very pleased to meet you. Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone. Maybe by now they are. They're moving pretty fast. They wouldn't take it. You're insane! What are you doing -- Sis. Let me take care of you for once. But Johnny... you can't fly. Keep 'em coming. Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast. That is so sad -- I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid. What are you doing, Travis? I been told to take your car in, Sir. Why? I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy. Something to drink, Dr. Bright? No, thank you. You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy? What happened? Were you kicked out? No. What happened? I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven. Happy New Year, darling. Happy New Year. Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day. Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds? You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you? Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have. Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business. Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of... Other people? Small talk. It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk. What's up, sugar? Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven? With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry? Yeah, that's what we need. More agents. Well. I got an audition tomorrow. No problem. You go on off to bed. Stifler, you're such an asshole. Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd. They took him from me. It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open. I know! Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you. I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission. Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves. I'm running away. You think that's wise? Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys. Gimme the ball! No. Me! Me! Well we rang $900 today. Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage. Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type. You're not. Jack, you're on television. Shut up, Frank. Of course. Aunt Joan. And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much. I've thought about you. He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick -- Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her. He never ate the pre-nup, did he! I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician. Did Marylin end up with money? She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup. I don't have a pre-nup And if it is too late for you your children will eat it. Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet. No shit. You know how he makes his money? He sells guns. You ever see him sell guns? No. Then how do you know he sells guns? He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him? How can you help us? Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity. Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you? I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends... Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit... ... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity. You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers. Where's the challenge in that? Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively. You sound like my father... Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out. Sure. Town records are coming up now. What will they tell you? I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here. Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though. I didn't want to wake you. Yeah. Thanks.  For letting me in last night. Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song. We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child. John  Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please? I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you. Sorry. Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner. It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running. He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken. We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett. At least not anymore. Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends. <u>Lynn</u>. But if you go back they'll lock you up again. No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy. Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much? Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests. Well -- I have to see Carl first. Carl who? This could Pbe it. This could be it. How often you fight like this? Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia. What do you get for winning? Respect. Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations. This is insane.  You've got no proof. Is Valentine here? What do you think? Not time yet. Make it time. What if someone else buys it in the meantime? Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed. Why does this have to be so hard... Tell me about it... I'd like you to meet Somerset. Hello. Talk to me. Let's assess. Right. Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount... Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back. You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938. Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk! I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie. Thank you. I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside. I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge. Two down. Two to go. Down?" Wait, don't tell me. The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. Who's idea was it? Mine.  His.  We both...thought... Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density. Thanks. Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you- Uh uh! What did we talk about? Right... Sorry, sir. They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here. We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer! Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like... Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd -- What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me. Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks. He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors. Why? He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic. Why, yes. This is amazing. If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself. Oh, wonderful! What do you want? I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan. What plan? Just get him to stop. What do you want to do, leave the station with her? Yes. Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours... Her oxygen would have run out. Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check? Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt. Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at. I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest. Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait. I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe. I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here. Really? My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come. Then he didn't send you? No, sir. This is my own idea. I see. Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted! Sure you don't want your wallet? Don't think I'll need it where I'm going. Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act. I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit. Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family. That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me. Your father put cigarettes out on you? Out on my back when I was a small boy. Can I see your back? Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific. Thanks, Lloyd. Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this. Uh ... thanks. When'd they file the demur? Yesterday. That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got? Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security... No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you? I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared. Michael, give us a lift. OK, get in. Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping. Yeh?  Who else? And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does. This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping? I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor. So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh? Rasputin! I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be. So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger... Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off. Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service. Tuttle! Are you from Central Services? Ha!! But ... I called Central Services. They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call. What? Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup. Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back. You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid. He's lying. Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten -- I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere. What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch? If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur. My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else. What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage? I'd say you were full of shit. Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth. I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office? I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it-- Do you love him? I like him a lot. Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags. Don't ever stop fucking me! Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop. Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!! Alright. Let's talk business. Why not? You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate... This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you... I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you? You're not real.  None of this is. That's my scientist. So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin? Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything. But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola. We thought this might make things a little easier. Hello? Mr. Van Dorn? Mast? Yeah. Where are you? The connection sounds very good. I'm back in Grand Rapids. In G.R.? Why? Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel? I've got a meeting... What are you paying me for? I'll be there. I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit! Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya. That's it, everybody out. We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard! Yeah, but not in here. What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source! Like I'm responsible for all the smokers! The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant! Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight. What? What?  What?  The leads. You have to steal the leads tonight? That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest. You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and... You... I'm sorry? You. If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today. [Beat] I'm not deaf. Good. You're not real.  None of this is. That's my scientist. So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin? Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything. But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola. We thought this might make things a little easier. I think we should see your uncle. No. This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame. Forget it. What is it? Is it stuck? Did he shut you down? All but .. How <u>you</u> doing? I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators .. I wish he'd tell that to Citrine. What? I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz. Got a bogey, boss? I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes? Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up? Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop. What are you doing with the Ivans? I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now. Just a moment.  Starling didn't... Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun... I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from... ...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..? At-at-at-at-at. This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it. At-at-at-at-at. She was never attacked. I think she made it all up. Why would she lie about it? For attention. The girl has some serious issues. Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right. Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important. If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it? I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... . She wasn't in...you were al... There's no witnesses... No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...? Birdy... I didn't mean to-- What'd he say? Birdy... Baked with a butter-lime glaze. Now we're talking. Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles. That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead. And your principles? I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles. Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore! Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them - Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie. Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed. What?  No, I know they're civilians... Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for... Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi? May<u>be</u>. I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year. You are precious. Please, call me Gale. I'll take this instead. Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it... Can't leave me now. Aha. The thing is, can you go the distance? Depends what it is. No, depends on nothing. She - she said I - I was a --- - a witch. Merry Christmas, Jack. Merry Christmas. Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able! I knew you'd like him. Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse. Good morning. Good morning. Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive. Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up. I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ? Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago. Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future. It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong. And Dieter? He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back. That shirt, Mr. Boone. It's new. I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off? I'm not wearing an undershirt. Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly. But it's just my face you want to draw. Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear. Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno. He had a pressing engagement. Philistine. Where's Little Bill for Christ sake? Ha. He was building his fucking porch. Building his porch! What is it? Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out! You make it sound so easy. It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look. YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT. ...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our... Coffee? Sure. I'll do it. Fanucci is not connected; he is alone. What?  You read it in the papers? This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone. How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here? Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you. Get outa here. ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit? Yes. It was very good to see her. Really? Any problems? Oh, my heavens! It's gone! Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually. What happened? That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run! What am I going to do now? Don't tell me your ticket was in it? No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it. You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville. Why, no I   Yes . . . I guess I will. I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean. No. I'd rather you didn't. Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name? I don't want it reported! Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that  See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her. Why, you ungrateful brat! You're staying home.  You're not going out. OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least? Swann?  What are you doing? Binding you. Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life. It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years. Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read. Yeah, I know. It might be too late already. What are you waiting for? I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary. Twenty. What's your problem? Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units? The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose. There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us. How's the water? Crowded. Oh -- ...Oh, did that hurt? No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh --- Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this? Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain.... It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut. Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here. Yes what? Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion. What question? Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself -- The 'question' -- Yes, Bill.  The question. Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots. Roger. We should tell him we're not going. Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland. Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business. You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they? The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court -- I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name -- Is that a promise you can truly keep? Got your ticket? No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake. Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore-- Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone. Yes. Take the test again. Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and -- Nothing has. But that's all changing. Maybe I ought to think about getting another job. Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch. Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going. Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself. You lied. I exaggerated. Good morning, Mr. Bebe! Who's this? Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option. Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more? I guess so, sir. Very fine bone structure. Wait here. I'll be right back. Where would we go? She's been bitten. You should've killed her, then. She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her. Jefferies. This is Doyle, Jeff. Tom, I've got something real big for you. Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be -- Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested. Your Lisa? My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police. I told you that -- I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it. Like what? Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it. A possibility. A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent. Like an old hambone? I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now! You think perhaps it was "old hambone? In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived? Where'd they take Lisa? Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money. Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff. Why is that? Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day. He's at work while I'm here. I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him. Well, he doesn't need to worry. If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry. He's not the type to worry. You found something? Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks. What? I'm not sure. A virus -- -- You saw this experiment? What did it look like? Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they! I seen 'em b'fore you did. What's this? Now don't you go monk'ing-- Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make. Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy! What do you think of the guinea fowl? I'm a vegetarian. Oh God. How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you? Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me. Well, nobody asked yuh. Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you! -- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green... -- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy? -- what guy? -- this guy with Jill. He's a director. I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses. And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known. For you. You shouldn't have. So you're straight on how this is gonna go down. You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie. She tells you how I've been-- --a philandering pig. But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me. Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen. I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better. How'd you get her out of town? Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo. And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move? She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh. I'll give it my best shot. Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you? You don't. Aren't you eating? No. Why not? If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry. Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied -- -- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you. She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her. Buffy? I'll be home in time for supper! In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If.... Go. Hey!  Would you? It was fifteen seconds. I don't think so. Are you always this much fun? Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun. Me too. You're not... seeing anybody? No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed. I have? You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different... Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesn t prelude a meeting in private. It doesn t, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is. The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314. What about Job? I wouldn t worry about him.  Once you ve got the money -- he ll find you. Yes, but... You are, aren't you? Certainly, but... Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother? What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor -- I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws? He's smart, powerful, successful -- Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him. Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there. You mean he's not a criminal? Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them. Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract. What's that? Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi. Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours! Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her. You haven't seen her yet? No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera... That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged. That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen. You just told me you hadn't seen her. Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby. Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like? You can't imagine. That bad?  Old or young? Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes. You saw all that in one glimpse? Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you. The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter. I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place. In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish. Did she drown?  The woman you told me about? Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet. It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why. It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project. What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project. A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology. Jesus Christ, Castor. Drive. The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation. Are they behind us? No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot. I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain. As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi. Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch. No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going. Yes. Go away. Let me help you up. You look good... You, too, Ma... What are you doing back? How's Kip? Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to... Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it. I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it. Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me. All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They... Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around. I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner. You asked me what was missing. What? From basketball. you woke me up to tell me that? It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing. And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings. I admit, I can be bought. We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - - I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not. - - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct? Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all. Bacon, see what we got. Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden. Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building. Perfect.  We'll be there. Now for the real question. NOOOO.... But you're doing so well. Please go away! Leave us alone! Then answer the question. Same category. But, we have to make a smart plan! Of course - of course!  Hands in... I'm telling you, I was there. You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was. It wasn't a trick! Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick. Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you - It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan. There weren't any wires. I looked. Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors. He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors? Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce. Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip. I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws. You're just jealous. Jealous? Of what? Of this...Superman. Easterners. We're just fine, thank you, sir. I love you man I love you too. Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee? Coffee. Zwei zwartze. Jabez -- help! Coming. What day is it? I don't know. Tuesday? Wrong. It's Friday. Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense. Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down. C'mon I can read for Christ sake. Well what's wrong? Well why are they tearing the building down? Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe. Hiding? Happened...Yes happened right down there. You saw it? Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue. Why didn't they bring him in the house? I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school. J. C. Penny's? In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone -- It was you, Juliet, it was you -- -- instead of what he is -- What I am. -- which is -- -- which is a hack. The man we know and love. A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet. Know and love? Yeah. I think you're lying. You're right. You see, they don't really know me. No, Alex, we don't really love you. Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever. The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea. ...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive. You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat. B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door. Thank you, ensign. No problem, lieutenant. You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like. This must have cost a fortune. It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway. Do you have to leave the note? It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so. I'm Cindy. I'm Hanson the caretaker. You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you? Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again. ...so where is he? Where is he?! Where is he?! He's not Nick Mason... I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee. I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker. Spencer of the Chronicle . Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening. Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it, Ask Travis. He's the ladies man. To our family. To our family. Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich! Must have been? Used to live? I do live here. Oh, yeah. Gru -- you are positively radiant. Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you. Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them. Aye, sir. Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to... Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is... The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds. What does he want the book for? Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister. What's this -- ? Cadillac. Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up. Why? Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but-- You don't know me at all. Um-- Kay? Thank you... Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase. What? Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up. I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong... Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about. Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing... With a Ramses graph on the binary tree-- --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side-- Maker can. This is not new, Gerry! Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me. Don't ask me. Tell me! All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time. Is it true? Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know? You were terrific, too! Hey.  It's raining. Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys? I suppose so. He never told me about it. No wonder he was angry. He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks.... Fuck you! Fuck you! Yeah? You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?! Now move along. You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with? I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow. You could sell your Beamer. I'm not really dressed for a party. Relax, it's casual. No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty... What? Your wire Ester - she passed away. I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you. I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better. No, you don't!  He does not work well with others. What do you mean?  What's he do? He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years. Our cemetery? Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go. This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family. The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that? I wouldn't go outside. Why not? Just take my work for it. General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down. Last time you didn't even scratch it! That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood. They made me go with them. Sure they did.... Can I have some of your water? Get on with it, counselor! Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you. I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down -- There's always an excuse, isn't there? I think it's time I came home now. That's not a decision for you to make on your own. Your friend lives in a fine building. Oh yes, the very best. You make it sound so easy. It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look. We don't want any.... Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five. Do you think you're alone? What? Do you have a soul-mate? Define that. Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate. Yeah. ...touch that. What the hell... Kids' game a couple galaxies over. I guess I lost: You got smeared. ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent. Thank you, Quince. But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week. Next week? Yeah.  Or the week after. Me too. Sounds swell. Really? It seems so fattening. - - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - - That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly. I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice? I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time? Before the actual accident? Yes. And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer. Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo. Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big. They all sound big at the talking stage. You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President. Yes ... I have no idea what I'm doing. Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?! I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong? I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe? I don't know. Ted, we've only got ten minutes. Not now, Elaine. I mean until we start to burn up. Oh, let Henslowe wait. Mr. Henslowe? Let him be damned for his pages! Oh--no, no! There is time. It is still dark. It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so! It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl. Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent? Of course. Eight thirty. AM or PM? Pro, the sun's out! Oh, right, right... Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time. Stop! STOP! Kansas! I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies -- Gin? Where the hell are you? I'm in the middle. In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him? He's on to something bigger. Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out. Too late now. Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you. I'm going to get him, I promise you. Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. Pre-Castro. Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like? Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket? What? Hello? It's me. Telly. Hello? Paul it's Telly. Open up. One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me. The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill. He was aiming a huge spear right at me! If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death. Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house. Why not? Please wait till my husband gets home. When is he coming back? I don't know. Where? Up ahead! Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft. Jeremiah... what's gotten into you? I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!! Who are you? Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal. Who are all these people? This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em. Oh good, there's nothing to eat. Why didn't you stop at the market? I still haven't got this bloody thing off. You could order something in. A boy comes to the door. I don't know... It just wasn't like him. Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring. They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all. You will follow me. And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you. So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons. What have you done to me? I -- I -- I... Let's go... I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that? Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part. You don't suppose this is just part of... FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for? It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful. You don't really think so? I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something? Please, Mr. Bernstein. Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful? Bloody well tell me who sent you. You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself. ... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too. You know, she probably means well, after all... She is a louse. Hey, bro. It's Case. Remember me? Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil. Mr. Yesil. I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail... If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical... What's "cynical"? It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God... If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur. My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else. What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage? I'd say you were full of shit. I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh. Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh. Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too. Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit? Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me. If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that... So I'm saying it... It's too late... What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late. Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him. So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know... Jackie? What? After the kids are back in school. Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents. Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine. Then what? Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got. Nothing on Hannah? A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail... Jesus--what's got into Nuke? I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril. I'm getting too old for this game. Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed. Any leads? We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand. It's my responsibility. Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life. Dad-- Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one! I never hear the whistle. Feed the dogs. Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie. Certainly a new experience for me. Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever. Where's it gone? Inside, Vince. Pop, for Christ's sake! You think you can take me now? Come on, try. Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours? That's unkind. Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy? Sure! Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something? Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father. No problem, is it at your place? Yeah. We stood here once before. I know -- Teresa -  I hated you that day  - you and your flip talk -  with that little girl lying dead. I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft? Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -  where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you. We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I. Hey where'd you go? I'm here.  Shut up. Come out come out wherever you are! Shut up.  Are you nuts? No.  I'm scared. Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet. I think we should go. No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment. AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY! You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about. What now? s broken. Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base? Look, if William Morris doesn't come through - What do you got on Korda? We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out. Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration? Being faxed over now. How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits. Roper... And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents. Roper, we're into it... Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit? Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too. How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law? She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking. And her farmhouse...? The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again. Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight. Good evening, Mr. Pimenov. Oh -- good evening, Baron. How's the beautiful lady? Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night? Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances. Well -- last night was not so good. I thought she was splendid! Yes -- but the audience. You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down. Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man. Once a carnie, always a carnie. Oh-yah. You have the body? She's buried. I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota? Winona. I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room. Naturally.  I brought them myself. Is that so! Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing? Who said you could?  Who asked you to? Jeez. I know. You're a monster. Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest. What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night. What do you want, hun? What happened to Bella? I'll tell you later. No way that cocksucker's driving you. Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl. Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin. Ho's a good guy -- Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife! Shhh. He'll hear you. Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you! Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay. I want you to quit. Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through. I'll support you. With what? Max offered to stake me. Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is. The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back. Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious. I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h... That's how journalists.  Answer questions. What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be? Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once. I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine. Mookie. What? How come you ain't got no brothers up? Ask Sal. Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here? Who is that idiot? Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave! Listen man, I think I have a problem. We all have problems. I'm pissin' fire man. Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady. Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero. Three-one-zero, aye! Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz! Huh? On, no. Nobody important. Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you? Uh-huh. I'm a writer myself, you know. Why is everybody up at sunrise? The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours. What did she do to me? She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered. I felt like she almost killed me. If she held on any longer she could have. And you think it helps calling her Rogue? What do my eyes see? It's starting.... Is it over? They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs. You are a fanatic. Gonna wait outside. I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz. And no one'll know about this? It'll be our secret. Showbiz. Sailor? You know what? I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here. Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it. Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together? In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance. Have a drink? No, thanks. No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca. It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame. I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God. Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley. It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing. Is that a blessing, Reverend? You must allow us to act. Let me do something. Martin -- your customer. Can I help you? Weird. But different. Those yours too? My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by. Who were these people? Ottawa! Excuse me... What man? What is it? Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while. I can't man. Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please. Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK? OK. I could see you were pining away-- Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday? Yes--I remember-- I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college-- I can't take any more school. --you're going to be on your own. So? So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends. They're not going to jail. Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things. Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year. That makes it okay? They stole our land-- Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me. Can I get my life back? Maybe. I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer? Is there a killer loose? Hey!  That's my boss! Better yet. ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance? No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile. They're giving out. De-crystallizing. Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott. Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home. Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it? And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks. I certainly hope not. Loose talk is the one thing I worry about. I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes. Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening. You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk. Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really. Is that alright, Frank? Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back. We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys. He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons. Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on. Yeah. You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away. Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude. Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for? You're soft. What'd you say? That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all. Are you sure? Let's find out. ...the truck driver... He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not... Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry. This is easy--I'm not hurrying. You still doin' it too fast! Hello? Hello. I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities -- That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria! Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria? Does Johnnie hit on you? Johnnie hits on anything in high heels. Has Caesar ever seen him? He does it right in front of him. It's getting better and better. Keep going. Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left. What did Gino drink? Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it. What I'm saying, they're getting some help. So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case. There is something very not normal going on here! This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie... Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"? I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I.... Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning. There are times when you don't answer the phone. What's that got to do with it? Back off, man!  I'm a scientist! Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play. Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie? You said something before...about laying him to rest...? You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground. I'm gonna have a corned beef. Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that? Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure. Oh. And your first wife was Allison? My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy. Oh. Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people. What kind of people? People who want to bend the rules... Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way. I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it! You ought to know why. Because  Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because  Because marrying that fool King Westley is  You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him. Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes? What's wrong? Don't like flying? Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on. Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen... Here. That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater. Very well. I suggest we go and look at them. The King without his sword, the land without a king... We are to blame. Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales -- Nick don't talk till Nick gets something. You do more than try. You do. Hope you're a good actor, Elliot. Good morning! What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good? All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened? The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system. But how? Wow....huh..."...piss and shit... What? You really use strong language. I'm sorry -- -- no, no, it's fine. Fine. I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know -- It's fine. I'm sorry. ...nothing.  I'm sorry... No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes -- -- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much -- I'm sorry. I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just -- ok. ok. He was deaf when he wrote this. Who? Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow. Who the hell are they? Brothers of Brother Johnson. Eddie, let's see that blotter. No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week. I'm going. Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too. You're staring at me. I wasn't star-- I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens. That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him. I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok? Why shouldn't she be? Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag. Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out? I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill. Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking. What is your position? Second musketeer. I understand you joined up in Bremen. You seem to understand a great deal. I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me. Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals. Equals? If you wish to play games, Major. Shall we go? Yes. Well, this must be about something! It is; we need you George. I'm feeling... I've been feeling better. Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you. I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up-- Shutup a second! God bless ya, Rock. Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try. I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah. She must still be on the property. I told her to get outta there. We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where? She's coming with us. Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her? She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing! What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving! Who are you? ...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer... And that's where you met Oswald for the first time? Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as... It s just a scratch. James.  It wouldn t really be... There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months... That doesn't seem so bad. But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself. He wasn't even in the car? Aslan, there... Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable. What do you want from me? At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table... You like that Vaughan? Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right. You enjoying yourself, Karl? ...When did you know? You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects. You'll be all right? Yes. I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this... Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change... I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay? Blow me. Thank you! The world of our children. How dare they? It's war. The weakest suffer the most. You're American. So are you. I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash? Yeah. Trickery and divinity. Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real? No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists. So could you walk on water? I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation. What about Swann's miracles? My Jewish friend's grandmother did. Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom. Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is... Can you - ? Jim, I don't even know his anatomy. I'm fucking out of here. Lawford? Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks. Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you? You weren't so bad yourself. We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8] Next week "East Lynne. After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan. How about Cinderella or a real hot love story? No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe. Oh, you are! Who made you the manager? I did! It was my idea, wasn't it? You always want to run everything. If you don't like it, you can resign from the company. I refuse to resign! Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself. Yeah baby. You made every day like kindergarten. What did you think of Lippman's column this morning? I think it's a bad idea. Thanks, hon. Time to shove off. Love ya, Margie. Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle. Is it one of ours? No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir. What are you saying, son? It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir. Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane. What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it? Where're they headed? We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion. -- what? I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted. ... That's great. So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ... 253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president. No way I It doesn't make sense. Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy. And 290 "disregards," right? If you say so. He said open it. Just sending a message.  She'll get the point. Veronica. What are you doing tonight? Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why? Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date. Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D. Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it. What do you mean by "weird"? Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him. I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee. That's very nice of you. Thank you. Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy. We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else. They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me. She never even looked at you. You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly. I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy. Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance. You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy. What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works. And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know. I am a doctor. I teach medicine. Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow? The heart pumps it. Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot? The nerve centers -- the brain -- But what makes a thought start? In the brain, I tell you. I know. You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look -- I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this. Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department? Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time. Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad. I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you. If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one... Then you should. If you're down, we're down for the play. Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can! Five seconds. * Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			* Can I ask you something? I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ... They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them. Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders! My legs are frozen. You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds. Sefton! What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog? Not you. What some brandy? Yeah. Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria. It's on me. You won't get off that cheap. What are the chances busting out of here? We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy. Everyone's looking... we shouldn't... Who cares ? You're right. Let's never stop... Back.  Neck.  Back. What? You did say birds? Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you... Lovebirds, I see. ...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend... Jen, listen ... I like--really need a cigarette, too. I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. You're gonna lose your share. If you don't... Shut up, Kid. That was my last. You've lost everything? I've no luck. Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... They were all over the place. You smell like ass! They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese. Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid. Good. What is your name? Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir. How was America? Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles. ...nightmare. What's up...? Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing. Yeah, so where is he? Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on. They got that kind of money? Their family owns... He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little. You've got an inferiority complex, you have. Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor. You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me. Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs -- -- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop -- You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me. What's wrong? I think I came. Didn't you feel it? I guess I did. Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time. Snifter are for warm drinks -- Yeah, snifters are for cognac -- When served warm -- What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker? We have snifters Then put my Martel's in a snifter. This town's full o' live ones. Not a chance. I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive. I know someone else who's sensitive. Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way. I don't think that's such a safe idea My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts. Andy, the theater's that way! Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond. Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen. Let's eat. If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers. Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go? This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television. Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i> We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark. Have Something. I shouldn't. Will you marry me? What? Will you marry me? Bobo, take the cart away. Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case. I was just about to make my point, Your Honor. I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light. Praetor Shinzon? Sorry.  I don't know anything about it. Come on, gimme a break. I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth. You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut! Get away from me! That wouldn't be too good, would it? Frank would open you. Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone. Does that scare you? Shut up. Beeeee careful. Come on Dorothy. What if Frank came over here and found us? How do you know him? We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place. What, again? Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?-- What?-- I think we'll live in Europe after we're married? I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married. You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you-- You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring-- I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think? I think we ought to walk. They just caught the man who did it. He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance. They'll hang him all the same. Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap. Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone. His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J. Oh, right. What do they call you, sweety? Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary. Mikey, you look beautiful! Cut it out. The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet. Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking. Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage. One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law? Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense-- Swell! What the hell's going on? Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow. Hurt!  How? Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here. When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles. I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing. How have you ... ? Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys. If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel. Well, what's the matter? I'm a little tired. Richmond is not all the way down south. I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you. Regardless, he still is your father. It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off. Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success. C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present. Peerless, last time, go see your father. Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened? The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down... Take hold of yourself. What room are they in? 1002. All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes. Yes, sir. Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here? I'm over here now. Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps. Sorry. It was last year. We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you. Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason. Just curious. Fran -- remember that last weekend we had? Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver -- Remember what we talked about? We talked about a lot of things. I mean -- about my getting a divorce. We didn't talk about it -- you did. You didn't really believe me, did you? They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me -- That's enough, Fran. Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow -- You're not being funny. I wasn't trying. If you'll just listen to me for a minute -- Okay. I'm sorry. I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it -- Handle what? What do you think? Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife. Of course not. You had nothing to do with it. Are you sure that's what you want? I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me -- You know I do. Fran -- When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask? Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you. Did you get it? Yes. But I can't tell you what it is. This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to. Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!... When could I look round? Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points... We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit. What about that guy this morning? You mean Shelly? Don't tell me, you're a workaholic. No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman. I suppose he just wants to watch. I don't need to pass basic seamanship. Let me see your hands... Have you seen Tamara? No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it. But she might be in trouble... So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend. I don't care about being hip anymore. Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more? I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family. Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves. After a while that hurts... doesn't it? What do you see as your main strengths? I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars. Homeless people? No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right -- Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses? No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us. Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor? Lacerda? Yes! Doctor Heller? Yes! It's me... Elizabeth. Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged! Thanks. How's your dad? He's dead. Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy. I didn't know you were coming. I was in the neighborhood. Is that the mail? Yeah. Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this. NO... no... I said leave her alone. Hi! I'm Randy. I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar! I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song. Oh, I'd love to. Okay, this is one of my favorites. Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve... You suddenly having trouble getting dates? Not by a long shot. Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose. I can't ... You must.  Luke, look at me! Well anyway... Your hair looks -- well fabulous. N turned into a frog - He was never turned into a frog! There are no gentlemen on the Tribune. I understand, sir. What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film -- I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart. I don't like to give up. Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break. What about Ray? What was that?? Hostage negotiations. Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell. I thought you were watching him. We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range. So what happens now? We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you. What about me? What about you? Do you think I took some of that money? I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story. I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that. We'll find him, not to worry. Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am! What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you? What is he doing in here? Relax, Burn, he's my guest. What are you thinking about? By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you. Really? Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy. What'd you say we're supposed to be doing? Hitch-hiking. Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking  There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic... She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day. It's your fantasy... But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her... Oh George, come on. It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there. Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear. Really?! During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains. Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink? The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906. Lyssa. Where are they keeping you? In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening. Invitations: the Museum Gala. No. The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser. No. The Hinchberger wedding. Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick... I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother? Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it. That's an excellent idea. Oh, hello Mother! As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me. It doesn't make sense. Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks. Oh Jesus... Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady. Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero. Three-one-zero, aye! Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz! I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder. Keep trying, Sergeant. What are you laughing at? He can't hear you. The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton. Tonight? We can't make it ... You've got a midnight matinee. Now, look here, Norm ... No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you. What? You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling! Or an on-line computer. That's crazy! What about that other guy? It's okay. Stick around, please? Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins. Get on the truck, Tatiana. No. I think your life's about to change. So you found Mary? Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something. So she hasn't changed? That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school? No, not at all. Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years. We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android. You mean a nano tech synthetic organism. Whatever. We should not go much further in this murk. Should we go back? We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning. I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think? Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight. This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin? If I can smoke it. You want a muffin? Donna, you are a muffin. Howdy, Miz Lampert. Who invited you? She's...pretty fast. You're out of shape. This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials. I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out. Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again. Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go. We could get back together too. Were we together? You're Starkiller? Yes, sir. Have you been checked out? Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2. Picked up something?  What is it? I don't know.  But it's something alien. Hello? Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing. Really? How much? Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey. A jockey? You mean, like -- Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple. I envy you, Jerome. You'll be next. I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here. Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head? That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer! Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes. I shall remember to pay it... to myself. No. Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit. Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss. Are you Teddy? My name's Leonard.							 * Did Teddy send you? I don't know. Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times. You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh... We were all upset about that. That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'? C'mon, I see what I can do. What is most important to you? I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct. I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances... Like where--in your dreams? Choices??? Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department.., What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him? It's okay. We broke up. When? Just now. Why didn't I? Uh.  You hate my guts? You better not miss, friend. I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat. Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it. Records are those big round black things, right? Fuck off. Umm, where do you want this? Oh, just put it over there. Good-bye, brother! Ray, come an-- How many, would you say? Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math. You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure. What? I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz. Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word... Yes sir... It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch. As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends? You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...? Hold on a second. I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did? Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'? What're you doing here? I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night. Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before? No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here. Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out. Rough day on the set? I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons  - Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real. ...That's what we finally decided. Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top. It's the tight girdle that does it. I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play- That's not solid. You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu. PARRTYY! We're friends of Beckett's. It's me, you dork. What's happened? I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer? How did you get that bracelet? You like it? I always did. Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones - Thirty-four. He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance. That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face. Okay, we got it. Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive. Macbeth, right? Right. Kat a fan, too? Yeah... Bye, sweetie. Okay, sweetie. ...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon... All right. Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk. Wow... If you like that type. Captain? Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim. Jim. Yes, Spock? Life is not a dream. Go to sleep, Spock. Yes, Captain. Goodnight, Bones. This is what began it. A box? It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle. Let me see. Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors. What kind of doors? To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which. Hell... I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth. And you came back here to solve the puzzle -- Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room. Who did? The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box. You're still afraid. You would be. They tore me apart. So you were cheated. No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible. How do you know this place? Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job. You know who we are? Tell me. We're the guys who clean up after the parade. I'm gonna stick this right in your eye. I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag. So do I. So what? I'm doing all right. Your brother's here. Jean... can you? I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough. Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan. I'm getting to believe you. This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so. She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is... I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted? The Sistine Chapel? Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world... Are you all right, honey? I was gonna bring it back myself. Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question? Certainly. Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened? Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  -- --  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco... I'm o.k.  I'm o.k. Sure you are, sport. Go sit next to him. Who? Mark Shale. Why? Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday. I don't watch him eat everyday. You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents. Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining. Honey, some folks just can't fly. It's marble. All of it? Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way. Thanks for pointing that out. Is he - is he gonna die...? Lock the door.  Lock it He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it. You did what? Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me. Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here! Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya! ...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different. I am? Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it. It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth. You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...? HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him. What!? I'm not going down there again! This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go. This is a bottleneck waiting to happen. You mean you had a bad dream. No, he was real.  Like on TV. Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do. What the fuck is going on? I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious! Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar! The address?! York Ave. No, thank you. I'd like some tea, please. Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house.... I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do. You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone... Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are. ... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant -- Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead. Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days. En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us? All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out. So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible. Yes. Really? Did you play in a band? Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar. I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George. How much time do they get to spend with their dad? What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time! This is a little nuts. Turn the tapes back on. Fine. I LOVE YOU, DOMINO. <i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i> What do you think? Sounds like a plan. What do you really think? These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Why? I was trying not to tell you... What? I'm dizzy and thirsty. I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard. It's our pleasure.   	As long as my feet held out. And not a sign of the leopard? Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians? I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff? What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything... God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas. You really think it could've dropped off an airliner? Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink? I can't tonight. All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here. Would you rather leave? No, I don't want to be rude. Well, then, sit down. She's gonna kill Scotty! BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR! ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS. Where's my pill...? I just came to say goodbye. Where are you going? Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here. I think that's for the best. Good for you. Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms. Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites. Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret. What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie? It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing. I don't know. There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt. Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas? Sure, great if you ain't married. Don't touch a thing. Don't worry! If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel. Well, what's the matter? I'm a little tired. Whose son am I? You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur. I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my-- Have you been hurt? Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but... You were in an accident? Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman. So here is my candidate. What do you think? But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*... We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone... No way. If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick. Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean? What's up? Where you guys at? Driving in circles, waiting for- Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul. How do you know? Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town. Should we head for the Interstate? Would you? No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound... Me, too. Some crew you got ... If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield? You're freaking out here man. You've gotta get her out of your head, man. I do need to see Starling. Starling? Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here? Yes he is. Well, I need to speak to him. What is it? I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers. Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman? I don't know! Suga! Who's Jacob? My baby! What, you named it already? Thank you. You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome. The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus? Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally. Next to your father? My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father? Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions? You charge by the hour? My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew. Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired. Why? They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand? I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around! I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions. I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials... ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important. Where's the woman? What? Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box? He gave it to me. I don't understand. Where were you the day he died? At a horse show. That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why? Did you kill my father?! No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works. Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long. Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you... I'm talking to you, Tita! Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?! You know how I feel? My mind's not on guessing games. ...Hello...? LAPD. Open the door. How's it coming? You don't think I'm insane? And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret? No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed? Sounds like kind of a good idea. Really? Definitely. Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ... Very good, Steed ... I speak English. Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here? New York. Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York? A cheap hotel. What are you coming here to do? I'm here for movies. Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies? Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white. Excuse me? Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. See!  See, I told you. By letting me help you. Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you? Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven. Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub. Oh, tut, tut, tut. I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive. Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . . That was a CHEAP shot! We couldn't have done it better ourselves. I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission. With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it. This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral? Yes, sir. And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral? ...a <u>liaison</u> position... And what does <u>that</u> mean? ...I feel that... A liaison position with the Opera. I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ... And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home. But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it. But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff? And I just liked you so much. You did? You liked me? Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done. You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn. He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire. What about "60 Minutes. Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001. But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like -- Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for? You're naked. It's my house. Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look. He asked me to see were you all right. He's very very sick. I know him. That's Noel. We'd better go outside. Quickly. That was lovely! You know you almost got us both Killed back there? Fun though, wasn't it? You'd die for fun? Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed. I laugh sometimes Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy? Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean. You're a little touchy about it. I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy? Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife? What about her? Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life? Where do you get these questions? Just answer. I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know. Doesn't suit you. How would you know? Just doesn't, that's all. Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven? Room service. Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell? Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u> It goes on and on. That's really great. Bitch. Slut. Witch. Tramp. Landon! Later. What's he joking around for?    He's been shot. He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it. Let up on the brake! What? Cold feet. You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events. Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!? Help me get her off the rug. ... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ... I know it well, sir. It came over from Vietnam, you know. Sir? That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed. Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie. Look, uh...  All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world. Madam! I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee-- Madam! By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night! Why are you doing this? Doing what? Robbing a bank. I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right? Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough. Well, how much would you like? Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story. I have? I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset. Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel. Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you? No, Dad. Are you sure? Yes, Dad. If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning. We don't have much choice then, do we? Grandma Death. You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day. Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy? Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries. Chances of recovery? You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze. Hello. John Triplette. Hello. Glad to meet you. I miss Orville Redenbacher already -- Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart... You're an asshole Adam. You're an asshole. Oh, and why am I an asshole? Multiple reasons. Name one. I don't have to... Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going. Were you close to your father? I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke! You bet, Mom! Coming up! Vegas, baby! Vegas! I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own. You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really. Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells... Peter keeps asking me out. Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you. The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf. We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life. ...Sue... Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once? ...Shut up, Sue... I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch... Sue! He's jammed the mechanism. Now what? Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that. Why did you come here, Grady? You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that. Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time. You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever. I don't deserve Ohashi's respect. Why the hell not? I don't, that's all. We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything. Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right? Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment. Was Mom an adjustment? I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there? Nice car. How much did you pay for it? Too much. Eighteen hundred. Okay then... Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that? I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think? Not me. But other people seem to. Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it. Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you? No... Actually, you look more like a cop. It was sinking. What was? Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows. You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song. Bye bye blackbird. Is that what she used to sing? I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die? I don't know. Like do you believe in heaven? I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it? I'm starting to forget her. I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom. Ow, what the hell? Sorry, I thought you were dead. I don't believe it ! I got Games & Theory. What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on? If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there. What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on? If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped. Hell, we're equipped -- Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it. Security. No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary. She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you re implying. Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke. Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp? Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer. You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph? Glooph is not a letter, sir. Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order. What do you think it is? I think it's a gun pressing against my dick. You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga. Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other. How'm I doing so far? So far you're great.  You got a cigarette? And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water... Steam. Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it... Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money. Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex. Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him. I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God! Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps. This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again. Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him. They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex. Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting. Then it's war? Yes. How're ya fixed for ammunition? Bah!! THEN IT'S WAR! What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene? Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent. How do we know this is the way? We blew the Horn Resounding. SHE blew the Horn Resounding. That was cold... No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold. What kind of doggy is that? It's a Borzoi. Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me... Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you. I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was? Dawson, sir. Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night? Drunk, sir? Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay? I can show exactly. No!  You gave your word! Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where. Tell me about him. Tell you what? Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness. Why not just buy your baby a night light? That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted. With, like, images? Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be. What's your name? Easy. That ain't much of a name. It's easy to remember. Easy Lay. What's your real name? I don't like my real name. What's your real name? Iris. That's a nice name. That's what you think. I guess you forgot something. Huh? You forgot something. What? Well, aren't you going to make a deposit? Sure, sure I am. Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you. Oh, shucks . . . Hey, Max. Yes. I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I? Gregor, is that you? Much to your disappointment, no doubt. It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened. I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me! So what do we do? What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do. These things are wild...  What do you think? Makes you look like a nun-- Are you going to apologize or not? Fuck you. All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow. Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up. Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you? Sorry ... Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day. Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can. If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this? You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow. I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you! Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition. I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking. You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print. Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything. You're a great kid. Don't you forget it. I'm on the run! What's happened? The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once. Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here? That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either! When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself. What did she mean by going flooey? I returned recently from a stay in hospital. What was wrong? Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke. How long have you been running this place? How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long. I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else? No, Ernie's is fine. I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start... Where you going? C'mon, Tom. The city's burning. That bad? ...Then some. I am Luke Starkiller at your service. There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here. And--? And I love poetry above all. Above Lord Wessex? We were thinking of putting in a pool. `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend. What? There are things that speak to us from the past. I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them! What danger? I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules! He must be quite a guy. He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max. Steven! She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp. I'm literally going to kill you! Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza. A pizza?! And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson. Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye. And this chest? There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old. Told you you'd like it. Now what's this do? Goes up. It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them. What did you say? He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents. No. You said I. I killed them. Don't be ridiculous. Don't tell me you've got something. We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner. Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment -- I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix... All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant. You know what she'll say... Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded? Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes. I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information. Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit. The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash? Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still... Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work? ... No. You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy? ... No. In fact, I d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know... I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their -- Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case. Something to drink, Dr. Bright? No, thank you. You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy? Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter. You damn well thought wrong. I'm terribly sorry old man. You going to work all day? I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one... The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again. I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom. I'm telling you it's not. No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum... That sound good, boss. ... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid... I like your style, master.  How do we get him here? There's only one way. I'll bet it's a doozy. What is this? Hidden camera. Wings? We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts? I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus. Well, some kids can't handle it like you can. Did one of those things grow inside her? It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come. How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed? He sounded fine. That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King. They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any. Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent? Of course. ... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it. You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material? Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October. As you can see, there's a lot to do. Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind. This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed. BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER? OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!! And the draft blew over the flowers. Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them. Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off. There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power. No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt. Weren't you down in the dining room? I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly. Oh he did, did he? I don't like anybody laying their hands on me. Just like they say; no fucking self control. If you know that just back off. Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway. And stop with the directions. Make a "U" and go back. That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up. <u>You're</u> doing all the talk. Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did. And look what happened. Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match? Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck. You're a superstitious fucker. Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad. Like what? Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all. My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today-- I remember you. I was wondering if I could talk to you? Are you a cop? No.  I'm an archaeologist. What do you want? To talk to you. I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman. Hi. Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow? ehh...I don't know I mean.... I'm having a party tomorrow. Yes, I know that sweetheart. Are you coming to my party? No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days. When are you coming home? In three days, darling, I hope. What are they looking at? You- they cannot believe you're still here. Nonsense. You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"... You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>! This is kind of a stream-- NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER! I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street! Had to do what I had to do. Is he not going?  I booked a flight. He's not going tonight. I told his father he'd be on that flight. Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight. Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy. And you're not the wife. It's not a contest. Damn straight. Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-... ...-fall. Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but-- But... ...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major... ...screwup? Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at... ...noon. Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian... ...scientists. You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet. Where's their protective... ...gear? It's a hundred degrees... ...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break? They'll get a break tomorrow. Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her. Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques. Heavens, look at that now! I've seen it. The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean? Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben. What? We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here? He's not going to leave us. What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line... We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions. Well, we won't do any of that shit! Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly. Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right? What is that? Take it. Oh? Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you. You're making it up pretty good so far. The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant - Goddam right. Yes. Yeah. But now I kind of like it. Hey. That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good. Hey!! We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub. No, I'm fine thanks. Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket. Famous? I've never heard of it. You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me... No... This is a business trip! She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that? Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her. I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible. You were there? I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers... Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition? ...yes. Ohhhh -- Ohh! How's the clock, Bandit II. Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way. Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself? I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival. I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance. Ten-four, hon.  This is for you. Is there something else I can do for you? Well, I'd love to see inside your club. You want to come inside? Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything. You found her? There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going. We need you here. I can bring her in. No. I'll handle this. Pride of a job-well-done... It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that. Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious. They're just leftovers. Is it chicken? I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast. Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika. Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think? You do. No! It bit me! You think? Is it me? No, you were fine. He's tough, your American friend. Yes, Sam's tough alright. And you respect him. Of course.  Don't you? I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop? Not exactly. Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then? How did you know? If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago. A chicken? No.  But you're close. A rooster? You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck. Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that - You really don't know who I am? No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is - But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am? You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes? I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes. I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth. No. That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there? Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you. I'm listening. It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone. Are you nuts, walking into a gun? You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance. I know where you are. Very good.  How did you know? The pipes. Will you use the troops? Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now? How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too? Do you want her to join us sometime? Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen... It isn't... ? We don't need him... We don't... ? You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did! You did the same to your God! Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out? She got me an abortion... But you said you have the worst reputation. I do. Don't you want to change that? Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true. I think that's all the time we have for today. Same time next week? No. This is going to be our last session. Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you. Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help. Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down? Hardly. Who's the girl? Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name. She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train. That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course. We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you. I'm wid it. I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing. Go on.  Good so far. I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw? So I hear you're taking some time. Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit. Where're you going? I don't know. India maybe. Why there? Never been. What about you, Manuel? I'm only good at making people laugh. That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that. I'm afraid you've got to. I'll be all right. You're my brave boy. Fuuuuuck Can your man handle that? I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him. Can you set that up? Sure. It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision. What about Judd -- he knows about us. Do you think the rabbit did it? I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink. And my compliments to you... Alice? I'm sorry. Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay? Jeez, we musta killed a million already...! Not enough, I guess. We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself. He thought it was a ghost. Have you checked the... Attic, garage, basement, nothing. Take the neighborhood. What's this? Your pay. Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show. Take it now. What about tomorrow? We don't need you, Frankie. Shhh! Do you hear something? Yes, sir. You try it. Me, sir? Yeah. Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now? I will hear you... but not now, not here. Who are you? Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me. Trial?  What trial?? Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy. But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom? It seems that the English care more about you than the French. The English?? Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen. Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap. What? Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know. How about some candy floss? Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it. Nay, Oona, tis not possible. A faerie's love makes anything possible. I'm promised to another! What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire. How are you? Very well. Thank you. Is there someplace we can talk? How about the Rainbow Room? That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else. I never knew. Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor. Oh, so this is a tall tale? Well, it's not a short one. I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful. Oh, God. I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have? Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore. Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it. Yes? Yeah, you would. Well, i-if-if you have some free time... Yeah, sure. Take a walk, pal. Who said I was a lady? Getting loud, getting loud. He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore. I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city. Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now. Oh, really? Bigger and better. Then how come you're talking to me? Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case? I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind. You sure? You'll be alright by yourself? Do you think he's here? Here? In Costa Blanca. Yes. Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day. What's the matter? Sweeney. Dead? Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby! Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he? I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country? Well, haven't you got anybody else? There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy! No! You've got to help me, Hildy. Keep away -- It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be. That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere! Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper. Get away, Svengali. If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week. Listen, you bumble-headed baboon -- All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more! Please! Will you just -- Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you? I'm not working for any other paper! Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack -- Look at this! I got to get home. Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you. What happened? Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive. You're all under arrest. Open up! Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid! Tomorrow night. No.  Tonight.  It's important! You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. Interesting theory. What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product. Child pornography. There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one. Snuff films. I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing. What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see? First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is. Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what? His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in. His what??!! Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point. That's it? Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan. Dr. Satan? Thank you, Baron. Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it. What time is it? What? I just wanted to say  hi.   Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work? Yeah. How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight. Why not? Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine? Who told you? I'm right? Who told you? That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops! Somebody told you. Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine! I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated. Maxine. Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round. Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date. Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant. Great. Hello. Hello. I'm waiting for your mother. She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. . Thanks. Why not sit down and wait? Okay, I will. She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy. Oh, I see. Have you come to talk about me? Not at all.  History. It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you -- Don't make me tell you, Jason. I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend. It's divine! You say that just to flatter me. Do you consider that a compliment? No. It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you. For what? I hate the storm. I hate it! The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died. But I am Barbara. I didn't die. My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead. You wanted to break him. Yeah. So did I. Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span. We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs. The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket. When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf! Madmartigan!  You saved her life! I did? And then what happened? We went to chapel for vespers. Hm hmm. I left early because I wasn't feeling very well. Ah, Mom. I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage. When? Last night, this morning. Like one? Fuck you. Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once. That sounds to me very remarkable. It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later. Maybe you're right. I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night. Why didn't you notify the police? Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home. Kay, I'm sorry... Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of. You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head. Huh? To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled? You mean, like posed for pictures? Sat for an artist.  Been sketched. What's to sketch? You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive. Broke is more like it. But expressively broken.  How did it happen? Football in college. You went to university? Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines. Yes.  You were a Marine. |      You turd! +      Mangy scots git! Look.  I'm warning you. What's he do?  Nibble your bum? Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones. Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others. I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others. A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him. Only in mutual advantages -- moreover... Just tell me his title. I don't know titles. Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not? Okay, we're in business. Right.  Auto-shop, you all set? Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie. You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you. Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh! You know what this is? Yeah, that's why I walked down here. Are you playing a trick on me? I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke? You do! You definitely do. Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. I don't go there. Too many party girls. Party girls? Can I call you? Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496. He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them. He needs our help! He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together. Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it! Oh -- I almost forgot! You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Shut up! I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away! Shut up, will you. Shut up! Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system. Shut up! What if I couldn't get to you? I was scared of what you were gonna do. When I found you? If I didn't go. Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid? No. I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you? No. What? This? -- OK? I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild. No thanks. Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school. The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum. Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye! That's what I deserve for listening in the first place. Don't say that. Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day. He really wants to play metal? He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that. Do it now! If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through? Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty. I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers? Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation. They're migrants. Migrants? Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss. Rodgers... this is no good... Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it. Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time? She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate? I'll do what I can. They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape. You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on? Marlon-- --Truman, what are you doing here? What is it, Mr. Stubbins? His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films. He is assistant manager of a video shop... That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home? Certainly not! Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young? No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins. Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA. I was waiting for you... Listen to me. Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car. OK, Dad. You are? Yes, I am. What are you trying to tell me? What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business. Why I don't... You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone... Excuse me... ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed. Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me. I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing. Verdell? Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day. There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on. That was too close. But we gotta find out what's going on in there. Oh, somebody else sitting there? No, no, no that's your seat. No... You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us. Yes, Albert? John,we're going huntin'. Who's going? We're all going. Nick's going? Nick, Vince, Albert and John. No women? You wouldn't have done that? Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too. I want them arrested and hanged! Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains. This is no game. I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree. Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything  I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind. Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind? It's in pretty deep. Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung. What? That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it. Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are. I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache. A headache? I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system. Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway... You're kidding. He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us... Wow. Where'd you go? I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night... Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself. Mmm, I could tell. I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks. I'd say you give a good dollar value. It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead. Oh my god, what happened? What's the travelling arrangements? Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey. And where do you keep Mickey? We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor. Who? Wayne Gayle. Wayne Gayle! Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie? Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good? There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die! Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground. Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small? No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do. Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem. Five-thousand per kilo. Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know? This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think? It's okay, everybody does that. I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean? No. I just can't have any social life right now. Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social. Be friends? Yeah.  With potential. Friends with potential. And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat. That's not good in prison. It's just not good. It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ... I don't think so, Detective ... Didn't you have no inkling? Yes; from the first night. The first night? Our honeymoon. How's that? She turned me out of the bed. I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports. Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5. I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me. Oh, this is terrible... Please go on. Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour. I'll cover the back. Stay in the trees. Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important? I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on! What the hell are you doing here? Why, what's up? Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy! A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked-- Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this-- I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--! Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that? I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry. Why won't you talk to me? Will you leave me alone?  Please. Well then admit it, it's a work of genius. I admit it. Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief! You are? Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me. I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first? You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get? Wave at the lion. Don't forget the balls, Ernie. Adam! See who? The Oracle. Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw. Hugh, I'm impressed.. We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now! No.  It stops now.  It stops here. What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work. Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping. Well, I am going to go after lunch. No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list. I'm meeting someone. Ah. Where? It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner. You can get out of the dinner. No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come. Come on, Letty.   It'll get done. What's up? That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman. You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you. Lead on. Dunbar will testify that you were. Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective. Yes - As a matter of fact, I do sing a little. Would you sing for me? Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing. Yes, I would.  That's why I asked. Well, I - Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again? Oh, no, that's all gone. Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing. You sure you don't wanna stay? Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed. I will.  When can I come visit? I don't know.  Probably next Friday. Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington. This better be important. Look, I'm Captain James West... Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here. Come in! Hope I didn't keep you waiting. Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced? Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much. So what happened? I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break. You must get lonely at times. Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want. Woman friends, too? I'm a loner, I'm not a monk. What...? Just a hunch. I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world. He give me your address. I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why. Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned. Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean? Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir. Why did you let it get into a populated area? It's taken on a disguise. Clarify that. It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband. A what? An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you. Ah? You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon... Who? Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia... When was this? This afternoon, about four, five o'clock. What they say? You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come. Marcus -- I've seen this window before. Where? That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here. Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far. And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy. ...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman? Norville. Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective. Yes sir... Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal. Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid -- It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile. He found you, didn't he? Get on the bus. Where's Molly?  She's not in her room... Just get on the bus. I'm not leaving without her. John, you can't help her now. What?  Where is she? John... That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm. Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings. I hear you. If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime. I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way... Fuck this, let's get something to eat... What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her? Fuck her. Diane. Ssshh! Sorry. Shut up. I don't know.  I don't get it. Come on.  It'll help you get Chris. It will?  How do you figure? Women swoon! But why? We're no leaving you! No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it! Lillian! Where's Jill? Who's it for? A relative? Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him. Ten thousand sounds high. They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before. Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery. Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom? Shiteater- -Or monkey fucker- Thank God. He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway. I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess? Yes, I believe so. Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then. This... was my home. His home. Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning. We will -- I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you? Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage. I'm hungry. You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story. What's that supposed to mean?... Nothing. Rose Rose? Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber? You...you're an American? Only if New Jersey counts. Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she? Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now. I'm looking for the writer. What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about? My wife's going to have a baby. How about that. Mmmm.  You have children? No.  No, but we're planning to. Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town? Yes. I guess you forgot something. Huh? You forgot something. What? Well, aren't you going to make a deposit? Sure, sure I am. Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you. Oh, shucks . . . Ronnie... Yeah, so. Now she's going out with Greg Barnett? So what do you want?... An autograph. I don't know why she'd pick him over you. And if I didn't want to come? I guess I'd ask you why. Because I don't think I'm crazy. You're not crazy. This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up -- THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE! Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now -- THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM. -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now. You ain't coming to work? Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East. I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything? And did they? No. Gabe! Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up! What? Go out and plug the cord back in. What?  Who pulled it out?! Who is she this time?! She is always Aphrodite. Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet? Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate? Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful - What piece? Richard Crookback? No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel? Who wrote that? Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since. Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona. And number three, Dolly. Uh... two shooters! Fan-fuckin-tastic! Did you say cops? Yeah. That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile. Fuck you Boyd! Any time fat boy! During the road test... Yeah? Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me. Huh huh. Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy. True. Alan?! They're not here. I'll go first. No -- I will. I stood up first. That doesn't matter. You always get to go first. Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups. I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different. That must be the one! Yes, he looks like a comrade! Get inside quick, they'll stop. Too busy eating us? Just go. I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else. I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device    it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it. Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer. Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking. What were you thinking? Yum, yum. Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room. The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso? I'm aware of that. So what's it doing in Tijuana? Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you. That's true. She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house... How did she know where it was? The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered. Can it kill me? It can, but it'll have to wait in line. Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him. You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him? Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station. Benes... What the devil happened? The Other Side got to him. How bad off is he? Brain injury. Before or after what he wanted to tell you? Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate -- Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think. What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not? ... Just give me time to think... Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs... What is it, Laurie? Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door! I'm scared... DO WHAT I SAY! NOW! It's the bogyman, isn't it? HURRY! Where is the Austrian? You... Fuck you! Thank you. You're welcome. And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where? I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father? Man and boy. Everybody says he was so brave. Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said? He worships Father. Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper? He's a vacuum cleaner salesman. I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille-- She met him at college. College! They were in the same creative writing class. College? She has a master's degree in English literature. What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too? He insults him all the time. Excellent! What's good about that? It makes life spicy. He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time? No. Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy. What does he do--of an athletic nature? Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet. Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure. He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father? Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise. Tell me some true stories about Dad. Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country. England? Oh hell. Dad was never in England? Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting. The sting. As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more. The sting. Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis. Tell me that. I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand. Tell me that!  Tell me that! Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. Wow. We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name! Mhravitch. We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound. Uck. Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet? I don't know. The story gets hairier.  Should I stop? Go on. We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there. Where did you get the poison? We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time. And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia. Hey! What are you doing here? I came to see you. How you feel? As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now. My condolences. His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma. I'll do whatever I can to help. He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it. Don't cry, Bubba. Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her. Well, gee, I try and have a heart. Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented. This? Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it! Oh! Who did it? Now wait a minute. Hickory! Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that. Oh God! What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote? Goddamn you! I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up. You boys'll have to go to work early. You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.  INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit. My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus. Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix. The Matrix isn't real! Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die. Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim? That's Natchez-under-the-Hill. Blacks welcome there? Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out. Maybe we will. Nice meeting you. But you're a big star! No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right. Hey, Barney. Mr Brown, sir -- It's cold out there tonight, Barney. Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you? I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit. Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money. There's so many... Just a few then. The big ones. I got Clawsen on hold-- --his dialing finger must be falling off-- --what do you think?-- --he went to her apartment and he told her-- Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down. Is there a problem, gentlemen? Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper! How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman? The Lord will provide. You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours? A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours. I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood. You were not. I was not. Patience, Willow. Courage, Willow. Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser-- --Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do. The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in. Hum. What? Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah... There was a body! I swear it! Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming. I wasn't dreaming. May I see your license. Of course, officer. Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me? Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired. Found it. Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood. I promised I wouldn't tell. Why should we trust you ? I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this.... So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me. Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter  whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard. That was unfortunate. That was a calamity! We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack.... I've been waiting all my life for something like this. What is it? Stay back. Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl? Tolerable, I reckon. Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go? Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay? It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me. No I.... Andy, you can't be sure. That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it! They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that? No... I guess not. What is your job title, exactly? Excuse me? I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy? I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am. Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know. What are you talking about? You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there? Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather. Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper. Here I am, Father. Take a letter. Who to? The President of the United States. What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret... You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person. No. I'll take a strega. What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner? Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that. Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif. It's a digestif. Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter. It can be different.  It must be. It never changes, Major. Colwyn ... You must move away from the Center. All the passages are guarded. I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich -- Thank you -- I intend to make a great deal of money off you. Man, it's so hot. Gettin' up, Carr. ...How's the paintin' goin'? Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year. Aw, hon, you're better'n them. They're real good. They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them. Yah, ya think? Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry. No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous - Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him? He was going to-- I know.  He was to take the fucking money. You're tense.  What are you all uptight about? You killed a man for no reason! Go on! No! That's an order! Fuck your orders! You have the body? She's buried. I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota? Winona. Hello? We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday. Hannah, we've... It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch! Ooops, hold on a sec. Not here.  They might see it. If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing. All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you? It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything. Then, close the case. I better keep looking. Where, how? I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel. You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom. It's got to make sense some way. No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti. It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home. Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time? Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years. You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for. You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it. Sir? That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time... Yes sir! Cathy  - how does it feel to have a father? What an odd question! I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind - or just because he is one's father? Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me. GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT! Mph rmprmmh rm!! I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny! MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!! AGAGAH!! So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night? Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess. Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night. What do you want? Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here. Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea. Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie. So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week. Queen Harry? It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff. Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason? Kaminski. Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide. Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid. What? They killed him. They threw him out that window. Oh no... Eight stories. Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it? Thanks. No. Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about? Who are you calling? The Marines. No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late? It's not that late in Seattle. Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah? It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife. What's the matter? We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes. Nothing but civilians, Gene. This is bullshit - we don t even know what Max looks like. Maybe we don t have to know what he looks like.  If he s got that list, he s going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops. Good idea. Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador? No. In Hampstead... Why? Don t jump any red lights. Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner. And then keep on driving? Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever. { a click } I only her you too, Sidney. Who is this? The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me. Where's Wong? That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired. You want a martini? No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he? You might not have done it had you known. You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer! Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests. Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we? Viktor, I'm so happy for us! Hello, Hal. The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together. You never were together, Hal. And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive. Clyde. Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day. Really?  She didn't mention it. I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it. Sorry, "dude". What's the deal? Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out? Why you dogging me up? They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor. Nobody touched me, I was at home. Who is it raped you? Nobody. Well, what's the beef? Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship? Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate. This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? Kinship. Kinship. And what's here? Unless I miss my bet... my wife. You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house. Really?  Well, come on, then. Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School? Yes, but I'm going to live at home. Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there. Good work, Ostreicher. Thanks coach. You're a killer, Ozzy! -- Thanks, coach -- If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off. From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously. Yeah, I heard that one before. I don't know. I want to see Robles. What do you want to see him for? I want him to lock me up. Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't. I don't know. I want him to lock me up. Pull yourself together, man. I'm fine! The blonde dish. If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain. Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here. They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base. I'm telling you they're probably friendly. Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say... Were those flowers really for me, Brad? Of course. How much did they cost? Don't worry about it. One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you? I might have his number on campus. That's all right. We'll find him. Sooner or later that's everybody. Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore. I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie. I'm not moody. We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any. Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit. Your son. He's my angel. Was his father stationed here? He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though. I might actually get the pasta special. You loser! Sorry. Good way to get your head blown off. I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn. We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing. What?  Win Vietnam, sir? This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips? Enough! Why baseball? I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home... And you went home unannounced, too? I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did. If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country. You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government. You swore, Pearl! John! Don't! You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell! Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks. Need a little help with that, Mr Collins? So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money. You're glad somebody tried to kill me? No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out... Yeah, like... Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic. It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it. Well, it shattered your faith in everything. I'm just temporarily off my game. You need to believe in something besides yourself. I believe in you. Where's Laurie? I don't think she's coming with us. They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight. Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night. I'll be bait alone? Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear? I'll have to. I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me. Was that supposed to make me feel better? You'll find the showers and things right back of the second cottage. Outside! Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside. I can't go out like this. Like what? Like this. I have no robe. Here take mine. I'll come back later, huh? Sure. Why not? Yes, sir. He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being. Good shooting, Danny! Good shooting, Rafe! Land of the free... Home of the brave! There's another one! No, man. I want you to have it. Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails. ... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow... How's Mom? A User? That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous. I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline. Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth. Rafe -- I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me. Rafe... No.  You forgive me. Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice. That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It -- So how do we do this? Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?... I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess. Well, you seem very professional... I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty... Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film? Ah... yes, enormously. Well, fire away. Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film? I did. Any bit in particular? Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it. Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit? We do the show live in front of an audience. Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny. Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite. Ah. Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting! In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me. It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun. I have to go now, before it gets light. But what if we can't ever find where we came from?! Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do. Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>! That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it. Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples. Rug samples. We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl. May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be? Huh? The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest? So you think I should? What? Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things. Like songs? Yeah, they could be songs. Yeah. You should show 'em to me. Really? Yeah, really. Now? Yeah. Our plan is to hit them as they leave. While they're strung out? Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half. Nothing for you to see. Leggo... My tap shoes. EUREKA!! Well this is the last time I ever rent here... You'll be missed. Screw you! Goodbye, Mr. Fielding. Goodbye? This is where I get off. Oh, you don't get off that easy. Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak.  Ladies,  I begin.  I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven... Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now. Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig. Yessir. Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz. That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run. Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor? What octopus motor? You know, to make the legs move -- Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling! Look at this! He won't let us leave! Who? The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him. Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it! I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream? What's the "bad" part? I might wake up. <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy! I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life. That grandmother of yours -- she's really something. Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone. And it doesn't cramp your style? Sadly, no. Well except for the lint. Lint? Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this... Why not? I just can't. Okay? This isn't working out for me anymore. Yeah, me neither. What time's diner tonight? Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking? No one you know. Good morrow, cousin. Is the day so young? Who told you you could sit down here? Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together? Think again! Father, you can't let them take him... Quiet. I'm not hungry. Not sleepy, either? No. I hope we get some more help. I wish it would rain... Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out? I have no next picture. Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up. Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela. You motherfucker. Nick, no -- You sold him out. Nick -- When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?! Nick, what are you -- You the architect? I'm the artist.  Like my mother. Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part. You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk? Well, you'd have to keep it under control. And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt? You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles. With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue -- With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue -- --no-- --goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story-- David, David, David ... I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen? Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse. Beth -- You did, didn't you? Don't do this. You bastard. Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright? But, then, I don't have a choice. Och, you do, Fergie. Of course. I forgot. Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal. You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed. Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek. Not in this thing. What is it? Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses. So what? If they are not here, he must have sent them away. Well then you've got to call her, man. Fuck calling her. I'm going down there. Have you told anyone that I'm here? No. Here now, what are you fixin' to do? Have a look.  At nothing. So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore. It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once. I'm helping George build his house. What? I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is. Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help. Anything I can do for you? No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down. Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut? Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back? Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark. May I have a suggestion? Yeah, what? Take your time. What do you mean? So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in. When do you want the assembly? Tomorrow. What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink. She told me not to talk to you. Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink. She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att... Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now. The ADM. Let's go. Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up. Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits? Right now? Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out. Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all? Yes ma'am. Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy. Mustard's good on 'em to me. Okay. Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here? Just wanted to see how your doing. I kinda screwed things up. I'm sure you're overreacting. I don't think so. You're always your harshest critic. She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her. Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say. Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes. And bears! What sort of an animal is that? It-it-it-it - it's a huge one! You got a place to stay? I just got to town. Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we? Them straw polls is ugly. Stokes is pullin' ah pants down. Gonna pluck us off the tit. Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy. Latch right on to that tit. Wipin' little circles with his bread. Suckin' away. Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot. Devil his due. Helluva awgazation. Counselor. Do you have a moment, sir? Of course, sit down. What?? I couldn't let him interfere with my project. There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there? I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year? I wonder where he's going now? I don't know. Suppose he doesn't come back again? He will. All his things are still piled on the bed. We had to finalize the deal. Everything looks in order. This has to happen fast. I know. It won't go unnoticed. There'll be red flags. Goodbye old friend. Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out. Could you show a little compassion?! Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house. Oh no. I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals. It means a lot...that you came. I had to come.  To be sure you were okay. This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog. If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you. Me? Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet. It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip. JESSICA. Are you sure? She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions. Okay, I'll take care of Jessica. Are you going to kill her? Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit. Don't you know who that man is? Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist. Yeah! And he's a perfect stranger to me. So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb! I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father? Splendid. Uh--that's good. And--uh--you? I'm splendid, too. That's--that's splendid. And how's your bill, Senator? Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new. Well! You don't say! It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit. Well--I-- Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week. You're not going to take your *suit* off! No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense! Now what? We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report. I told you about the pumpkin didn't I? No. Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree. Where did you learn how to drive like this? Like what? Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill? I heard them Morgan. You're strangely dressed... for a knight. I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean? I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me. Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?! Yes, sir! Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow. He ain't the only one. No. Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge? Is that clear? That's clear. Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me. Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n! Over and out! We have to have a plan. What sort of plan? Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there. Please do not talk like this. We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump. She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow. What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that? Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer? Could you be more desperate to read it? Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same. I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual... How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes? No. Funny, that's just what I was thinking... I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him. Girlfriend? ...She was on the plane. You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling... Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to? Chris, can you do me a favour? What? Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there. You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it. Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine.  Can you bankroll the bar for tonight? ...you don't have to come in... ...and rob the place... ...I thought that we were only talking... ...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices. Me? Absolutely. That's ridiculous. Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact. I didn't ask to be. Then tough luck, George, because you are. Why?  Why, because you only told me about it? That's right. Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...? That's none of your fucking business... You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two. Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu. Mu-shu?  You're hungry? Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu! You know, I really wasn't expecting all this. Well...I guess they did get a little carried away. What about holding your right arm up like that all the time? It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair! Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop. You okay? Just fine. What's the weather like? God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'. Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred? Captain Miller, I just want to say... The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks. Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself. What am I gonna eat? You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start. Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today? Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...! General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately. I don't know anything about that. Well, call General McAddie. I don't have his number. They can patch you in through the switchboard. Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden? Garden? You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan. I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why? Why Jack? Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end... Did you read her mind ? Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss. This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own. Just make sure you're there.  On time. I'll brook no denial! It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine. Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship. Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you. I don't love him. I love Ronald. So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible. But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it? Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it. I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one. You weren't complaining about my play last time. Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam! No. You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this. I'm going home. Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam! I'm going home Cynthia. Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do. I'm going home. I'll call you later. Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped. What? You really love flashing that thing, don't you? Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want? Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money. Beats working. I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest. So here is my candidate. What do you think? But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*... I've come to apply for membership in Brolly -- You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man. I don't know. You don't remember anything else? No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here. ... yes, I follow your thinking on that. We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings? Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little... Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her. Why, why do you think that is? Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know? Well, I don't know. What have you got there? You'd look naked without one. Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you. Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum? Not at all.  I'll catch you later. That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway? Repairs ... What have you done to my ship? You figger Scar means to kill us? He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us. Why didn't he make his move back there? I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality... Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible. Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here. Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em. I don't know anybody. Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision. Well, he knows a little about me. You didn't tell him your name, did ya? I told him my first name, and where I'm from. Have you been waiting long? A while. Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking. I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year? You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year. Eat something, would you? Can't. What do you mean you can't? Can't eat through a canvas bag. Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on. Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control. HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class. If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late. Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys. You wanna get caught spying on Albert? No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert. It's none of my business anymore... You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business. You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi... He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely... ...and he tells me to go fuck myself. What? Then he called me a faggot. So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out. What? Ho-  Hey, come here. I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss... Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities... You'll be getting me sad next. I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down. What fire and music? You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell? He came in four minutes ago. C'mon. You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -  the dancing, the singing and the white marble -- How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she? This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry. How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps. The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me -- It's just business. I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm. Karl, what are you doing here? Come in. I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor. Okay. This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight. What's wrong? Is everything okay? That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it? Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he? Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox. Okay, I'm on it.  Hey. Hello, Frank. Will you please speak to me! Theo? Another minute. What's this? It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom. Sit, sit...  Would you like one? No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely. Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you. Edvard said the same thing about you before he died. I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him. Enough! Permission to come aboard, Captain? Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you. Yes, we've been through death and life together. Yeah, thanks a lot. But he never talked. Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty. Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch? I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan. Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks. This is my business manager, Rowboat. Nice to meet you. That's a sharp jacket. Thanks. Oh, yeah... the explosion. Know what I love about dynamite? Do tell. When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on. I don't think so. Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe. No, it's true.  I have lung cancer. That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke. I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma. Are you suggesting I call him master??? No, of course not.  I just meant... All right then! The injector performs perfectly in every simulation... Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board. We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight. Yes. I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died. Died... Did you hear me? Cardiff Giant.' That's us. You sure? Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service. There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do. Yeah, right. You're going to stay in school. Do you understand? Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point? Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out. You watch yourself. Two lumps, madame? Please!  Thank you. May I? Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here. Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic... Darrell?  You know he and Jake are... You don't have any money put away, do you? Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere... ...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here. Yes, sir. If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-... So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun. Aside from the obvious? SHIT! FREEZE!! [How much do you want?] [It's non-negotiable.] [Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?] [I told you, non-negotiable.] Bollocks, I m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult. Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It s no big deal. I promise. Brilliant. Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore. Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck. I'll make it a dollar. Buck is a deal. I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else. But how can you say that? They're mesmerising. This is the one thing. I know. What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet? Okay.  But, what? The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify. Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it. Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films. What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job. Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic. Oh.  Sorry, Newt. My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are. I came to say goodbye. Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip. You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. So are you. You've got a vision. Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now. Did you break up with Charlie? Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time. Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me. No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard. Wait! I'll go with you! You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian. I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T... I'll call them, okay? It doesn't matter... I'm going to call. Do it for YOU. Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises. I know... You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about. Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing? Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening? I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio. We're goosed! Goosed by God! Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her? I'm confused about your past is the thing. Is that still lingering? -- just to clarify -- So boring, so useless -- I would just want to clear some things up: Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over -- This isn't meant -- -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of? Are you asking me that? Yes. Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become -- In aid of what? I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are -- -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> -- It's all important -- Not really. It's not like I'm trying to attack you -- This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three -- We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand -- I'm not sure I hear a question in there? Do you remember a Miss Simms? I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me. She does.  From when you were a boy. Mm. Hm. She lived in Tarzana. An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill? No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question -- Go ahead and waste your time. I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young -- And that's what you've heard? I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980. Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM! I need help, Audrey. We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood. What are you going to do?  Drink it? Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say. I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick. That's 'cause he's dead. Do you ever... enjoy it? I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm. No?  Why's that? Occupational hazard". Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him. I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say. Straight ahead. Hard to find doors in this place. Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie. What's that? Do you think you can read? Are you well enough? Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you! It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that. I look like fuckin' Chewbacca. Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you. It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? What's that? I'm taking a piss. I'll sleep around a little. Thanks, Cooch. And get rid of the dog. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA. Courage man, the hurt can not be much. Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm. I thought all for the best. A Plague o' both your houses. NO! Mercutio! Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem? The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked. I think so. Well, thank goodness, that's settled. Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile... Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth? There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man. I liked him better before he died. We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two. To do what? What do you do far a living? I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference. Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night   if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week. To see pap. Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays. I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success- I'd say you're already enjoying some. Show me something? Like what? Like... A couple of high rollers like you? Could you believe it? Wait here, I'll get you that martini. Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it. Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free. No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night. I'm not afraid you, Creasy. I know you're not. Are you afraid of me? It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening. And how did Lamar become involved? Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You. You say some of the children died? So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it? I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill. And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death. Not if I stay away from him. How can you avoid a man you've never met? So you won't help me? I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong. Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill. He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him. I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place. Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat? Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager! You want the title shot? Say what you're gonna say. You want the title shot or not? Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass. This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right? It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it. Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better. Someone needs to cut these bonds, then. What are you doing? Getting rid of my hub! I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could... Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect... You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more. Yes, I come. I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police. But Sacha always puts out that light -- -- Tonight he forgot. Yes, I come, I will do it. ...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl? I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga. He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide. You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new. Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need. Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us. I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it? Is smoking fun? Oh, I suppose so. Could I have a puff? I don't think your mother would like that. Just a little one. Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television? That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions. Yeah. ...ex-husband on the street the other day. You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*! Cut it out, Ma, or I'll-- You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it. Now don't get sassy, Ma. Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on. I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither! Lynn! I can hear you good. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes, I can hear you. What was his voice like? You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English. Did he pay? Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes. And Oswald? Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge... So you saw Oswald how many times? Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember... Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon. Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe. Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment. That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe. I hate the environment. Johnny...! I thought you were dead ! I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! ...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself. No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him. Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom. Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something. Sure, Dave, what's up? You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition? Yes, I know. You probably also know that we found them okay. Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail. It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine. Mama, what's... Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances.

Is this for real? Like for real, for real? Unfortunately, yes. Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take. Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke. I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.

No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- ! Your pain ends now.

Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them? You men are all so dreadful! I know we are.

Not many longshots comin' in today. Billie.  You ready? Do you believe in hell? There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight -- Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side... Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin -- C'mon -- Rasputin?? Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated. That makes him more than a hundred -- Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city. What'cha got, Bennett? Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now. Technothugs? No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me. I can smell it. You know, you've been very nervous lately. I can't take this anymore. I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago. I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not. When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world. He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea. Ah... sure. Listen, Antonia -- Tony. Now that I'm home. Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind? Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil? Wasn't deemed a threat. She led us right to you.  That's no threat? Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies. Really? Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will. He was hot, wasn't he?

All right, Robert, I'm all yours. Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower? Anti-Shark cage. Who's inside, you or the shark? You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself. It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that. What was it then? The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he... He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara... He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it. Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd... Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this? I think it's time to get out of here. Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years. Is it... Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy. Great place for lunch. Yeah, one of my favorites. You made the front page.

Here. This'll pay for a course in karate. We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note... You're not getting any navy contracts. Violet Bick! I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind. ... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are. The American people put me where I am. Dad! ...the solution presents itself. What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General? Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him. Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you. Well then that's not exactly dating is it. Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances. I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me. What is it you do, Sami? You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing. I see.   A master criminal. Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave. You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg? Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A... Special Agent Scully -- I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me -- Evidence of what? She's fucked.  Even if that story is true. Raw deal. Congratulations, dad. My cheering section. Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror? Yes. Thank you. I want it to have my children! Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark. Yo, hit the lights. Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"! Doctor Acula?  I don't get it. <u>Dr. Acula</u>! He's very strong physically. That's true. He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet. Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not. I don't want to do that, Goodbye. My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!? Her fella. I have some very good memories there. What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time. Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things. You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place. What does he mean by "target audience"? Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go. When we get here. Let her go. It's cool. Louis, the house is beautiful. My money's in that office, right? Uh-huh. She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'? Yeah. Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car? No. You sure? Yes. You better be, motherfucker. What? That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me. That can't feel good. No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist. See you. Probably not. Yeah. Probably not. Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right? No, not exactly. It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us... I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne... I... I can't stop her. We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead. God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes? Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide? Never reach out! Hello, Mister Wallace. Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught! Vince thinks... you know... Someone out there. Jesus fucking Christ. Who is that?!? What's in the box?? I don't know. He's not in the database - What's in the box, General?  What's in the box??? Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV. Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one. Tough. It's not a homicide, Lieutenant. This ties in with Nash. We don't have any proof of that. I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out. I thought we were planning a long rosy future together. So did I.... But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army... My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable. I'm afraid I am, just a bit. Would you like some brandy? Thank you. I'll have the fire built up. Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect. Why's that? Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy! Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you. Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick! Dolores. Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last. Why? So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that? How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States? That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying? To protect his people. I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him. Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you. John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard. Objection. Sure.  Lots of times. What's with the dip? That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution. I'm coming. No. I just gotta go find him. Two hundred. Two hundred pounds? Two hundred pounds. You paid two hundred pounds for this? That's what it cost, David. No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet. Well, I can see this is pointless... You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free. You're drunk. You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so -- I can't move my arm. You've got good days and bad days. But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day. What are you going to do now, Tom? I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise -- Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day? What? I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you. Oh Marge. What's she doing? She's praying. Hon? Got the growshries. Thank you, hon. How's Fargo? Yah, real good. Dad's here. Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle. When you have children, I hope you'll understand. When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them. You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before. Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it! But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all! Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction. I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act? There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world! What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh? Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again. You're really pissing me off. I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word? My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you? What about plan C? Fuck plan C! Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone. You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who? I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you. Sez you! Suck my dick! Where are they? Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe. No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley. Do you know Tom? What are you doing? I've got to find Scully. Are you on the Mercury mission? That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return. This is sort of high class... I mean porno movies. Well... mostly... My God! We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty... Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more? I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family. Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized. I will not approve it. Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland. And we will begin with tearing it down. Talk to me Artie. Kelly Van Ryan... ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know... Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension... This is insane. How do we get out of here? Sewers. Come on. So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school. Uh-huh. Any idea where I might start looking? She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then. All you want is a phone number? Well, I know you're busy... Don't play games with me, Ted. I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador. I don't buy it. You don't buy what? You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it? No sir. How was it? We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam? I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay. Chief Talley is the one who got you out. I need to talk to him.  Alone. Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man! Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it? Really think so? Ya got heart. Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker. Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare. Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring. Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman? I don't know! Suga! We're fucked, I know -- They got their stories straight. What? What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter. Are you sure? Positive. Hardy, they planned this. Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest? What? A man just called.  He asked her everything! I think you better sit down I don't want to sit Josie, you look Rufus. Who are you guys? A marked man gets wise and wants to come in. His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection. So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job? Yeah. You got a gun? Of course. ... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house. But the place burned to the ground. The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where. You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit. Projections were far too optimistic. Admittedly... Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share. But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything. Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>? My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions. The stock will turn. It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that? Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares... You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts. You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now... What? Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this? Want a pair of boots? Do I!?  Momma! Does that make it right... Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love. Where's Sid? Damned if I know. She ditched me. You weren't supposed to leave her alone. I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together. You've been back to Dallas? Yes. Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove -- That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained -- -- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully -- Yes. I know. Did I miss something? I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present. ...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Don't push! I love you so much, Gabrielle. But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan. But I don't know how to leave Lila. You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy. Cole, I'm sorry, I... That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me. I'm going now, Cole. I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy. Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army! We already have black soldiers in our army... Unofficially, General Greene. What's the difference? 26   CONTINUED: I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up. You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around. Then get up and do something about it. He doesn't look fifty. Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago. His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since. Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom. It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel... ... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit... And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ... What attitude? You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses. He's a guest in my house, isn't he? Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him. Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people. Do you really mean it? No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama? Abbe de Coulmier! I'm here. Surely you'll grant me a final word. Of course. Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch... I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson. The people downtown said... You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...! Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are? Cause their apartments might be bugged? Mom... I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again. All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke. God's sake, chief.  The President was shot. A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart. Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink. Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that. I thought we were going to talk. Last night. Oh. Well. I... Cardiff Giant.' That's us. You sure? Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service. Frankie opens them with his teeth. Hey, it's a sellable skill. Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors. What's all this squid shit? We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words. I understand, I think. Other women? Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew. You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing. I did more then that. Now first of all, tell us your name. Penfield.  James Penfield. This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen. I'm an idiot? Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though. Really, "The Freeman Centre"? No....The Asylum! Oh yeah, what's my connection to that? None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts. I've been saying that since we met. Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing. Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns! That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye. Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it? Give it back. Try and take it. What's a tree? It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went. Where is Earth? Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school? Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head. Don't give him anything. We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat. God, I've missed you. And I you. They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean. They're on autopilot. They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you. Damn it!  Don't be so negative! Where are your folks? They left. What about friends? I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying. How? Room by room, corridor by corridor. A Runner... Cathedral. A woman. You're not going, are you? Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here. Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart? Head.  Not heart. I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy-- --What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again. I swear it. Do you still have to do homework? Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions -- Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented... Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me? I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true. Well? I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes. Cheerful news to greet the morn. His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness. I'm Talley.  Who's in charge? Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator -- Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish   to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous. I think it's time. No other reason    no woman   not the little Miss Gibson? Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens? I ain't sleepy. I know. Scribbage! Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad. That's not funny. James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy. Where's Wilma? She done moved to Detroit. Ain't she goin' to take the boy? She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither. I been sendin' her money. Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick. Like where? I don't know. He's your boy. I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different. You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway. I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila. Oh, American, thank you. I like them. I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him? Thanks. Black? Please. Shiteater- -Or monkey fucker- Scarecrow? Yeah? Careful! Watch his hand. Watch his hand Don't! It might be for me. I'm not here. You haven't seen me. Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments? I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett. Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector? Where were you at twelve o'clock last night? That's very simple. I was home. Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party. A third party? Yes. The John Doe Party. Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard. Right, Skipper. Yeh, go ahead. At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good. You could use a new one yourself. Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp. Check. I need to leave you now. I will treasure this. Sally!!!! Want me to? Let it ring. What am I saying?  You don t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that s all.  Is that you? Is it...? Trouble at work? I don t think so. It s not Kate, is it? It's my lucky day. Hi. Want to buy a bed? Not much. What are you going to do? Go down there and kill everybody, I guess. The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried... On what charge? Did you lose something? Yes. I lost my remote control. Oh... Well, I'm very sorry... What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money? You gonna write me a check? We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal. Claudia, listen to me... No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor... Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer. Good point. Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom. L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans. I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse. That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers. I don't under-- The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now. Why would the Union-- Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant? My brother.  Get inside. Take a drink, Kid. Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger. Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street? Yeah.  Happening, isn't it? What on earth were you doing down here? Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this? She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me? Now could you leave me alone? Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same. Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings. Okay.  Great.  I feel good. So close... And so far. God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now. I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town. Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want. Oh, I couldn't copy your work. But you copy my work every week. Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh? I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table. Charisma? Or something. What? Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician. She's flying starships ! Who ? Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical I have good reflexes. Good morning. What do you have today ? I have an embezzler and his accomplice. ...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew... That's enough! I'm asking how much. Dad -- It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing. Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that. That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment. Sorry.  I thought it was empty. It's alright. Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women. Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann. Sounds good to me. Let's do it. Who exactly ARE you? What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson. And who IS Ted Nelson? I DON'T KNOW! Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as-- Hi Jody. What can I DO for you? Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers? They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for? Twenty eight years ago. Follow me. I will - good night Mrs. Swicker! What's the matter with you! Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy. You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan! Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter? Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'. Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose. I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house. Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative. All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension. I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out. Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do. Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home. You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out. Open it! Open it before they get here! I can't till the hatch is flooded! Last hand. Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we... I have no idea what I'm doing. Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?! I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong? In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead. We thought-- One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are. Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place. Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac! That's my problem. Just put in my bet. Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution. Yeah, a good political solution. ...how can you talk to me that... that... Rick, I'm going to flag a cab. I didn't rob... Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid? Of what? Is it done? It's done. Lynette, where's Sid? Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win? Will this light do? Don't artists need good light? Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet! No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over. He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over. Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back. This is Agent Mackelway. I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right. Ten A.M. Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry. I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation! Calm down, please. Doc... Lily. Doc. Where is your mad pilot? He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead. That was uncalled-for. I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink? Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on. You did kill those men. Not all of them. When you finish, what then? I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin. You make it all sound so simple. The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in. You want me to front for you. The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I. I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way... We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out. Primitive? I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People. Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more --- We've got some things to discuss. Admiral on the bridge -- Battle stations. I think so. You're bleeding pretty bad there. Harry!  Where are you! In the helicopter. It's okay, he just wanted his machete. Three...two...one... You're really serious, aren't you? Yes, I am. But what about the past? Our past? We never really shared one. You're inhuman. I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me. Out there. No way. Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops. Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you. Shut up and deal! I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened... Not yet. Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works. Great.	When can you do it? Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department. I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens. You're not going to be there? I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence. --which Young? Larry Young, a California lawyer-- Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business. Now just a minute, I  What do you do when you come here? I sit. I think. I play games. What kind of games? I like to play "reality". Was that your dad? Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor. Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me. No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs. Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this? Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away. Jack, we'd better go. What do you mean? I'm starving. Go? <u>Where</u> are we going? Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik. It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved. Stop acting like a silly little fag! Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a-- Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle! Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers. It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk. Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that. We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it... Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help. Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation... You and your pep talks. Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for. That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer... Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night. Vaughan, don't get pushy. I'm sorry. Think I spoke too soon... Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference? Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs. OK, see you downstairs. Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe! . . . Tubby? Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders! My legs are frozen. You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds. Sefton! What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog? Not you. What some brandy? Yeah. Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria. It's on me. You won't get off that cheap. What are the chances busting out of here? We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy. Fuck man. Come on, Bobby. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... Jesus... Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge. We can't do that, Bobby. You!  Are you the mother of that child? No.  I mean yes. Leggo. I got to wash it out. Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then. What will we talk about? Everything. I thought you said Krueger burned to death. That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world. Uh-huh... Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection. Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too. We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it. It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography? Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications. Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers! Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together. Get away from me! Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training. Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us. I know. It would be almost inconceivable. But not completely inconceivable? I suppose it isn't logically impossible. I guess it isn't. Still, all we have to do is ask Hal. I don't suppose there's a drink left... You can have one at Max's. I don't think I'm going. Why not? Because I don't want to. Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you. No, it's not.  It's for this. It's the same thing, isn't it? Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me. You're being childish. Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ? Mr Decker.... Are you dining on worms? You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died. The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us. Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party. Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty. Carter, would I lie to you? You see ghosts, Cole? They want me to do things for them. They talk to you? Are you all right? OWW...MAN... -- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight. I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right -- -- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why -- -- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there? No. He's somewhere... Thanks, I see him... So what about kids? Kids? What about them? Do you want them? Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now. Why is that? I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking. You need to say a bit more than that! Oh... er... yes... Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you? Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident. Did you muss up her hair by accident, too? You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it? Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her. I didn't ask you to come away with me-- Oh--a hundred times-- --and I can tell you where to get off. And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine! Will you leave me alone? I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you? Baloney! No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth. I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do. Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts. I see what you mean. That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he? He's real. What kind of guy do you think I am? Thanks, Mr. Gittes. Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly. What happened, Michael!? Nanook... What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?! Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood! Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson? I'll have a highball. He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him. Yes you did. Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love. This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it. A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang-- I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach. What do you want? We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it... WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO! God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness. Annabelle sucked her thumb last night. I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie! Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me. Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die! We already know. All about it. It was on the television. Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around. So be it, to the death. It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must. Mother -- ? May I speak with you?  Alone? I am preparing for a ball! We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy. Sort of. Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it... Why do you ask? No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten. When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past. But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything. You really believe that? Stuck with what guy? What? You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy? No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday. It's your birthday? Yeah. Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday! Jesus, you're the man! Come on, what's under this? Three down, four to go -- Then don't waste time talking to me. Dance? No thank you. How did you hurt your hand? Just an accident. Nothing. Turn left ahead. It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look - You, too I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich. Neuvich, the clown of the crusades. But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do? Offered the Pope one of his whores. Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us! The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her. Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow... I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing. Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot? Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours. Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us. It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there. Hi!  Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy -- Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy. I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo. Ye-ah.  Sure. He's chasing us! I don't believe it. Full throttle! To port! harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction -- Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ? It doesn't say -- You're not out of Pascagoula, are you? No. What's up, fellas? Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes. Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment. You've got something going? Did you see that Central chick? Brunette? Yes...You're not a socialist then? No.  I'd want to-- Good. I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential-- Are you going to have coffee? Yes, please. And you'll join me in a sambucca? Thank you. What -- what are you doing? I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this. C'mon. Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there. Yes--I think maybe you'd better. You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of -- Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked. If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy... And Jos , my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...? Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender. ~Don't shoot, G-Men... No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena. I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer. You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible? Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows. You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter! By the way, I'm not much of a pool player. Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know. Yeah? Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game. Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me? Nah... how much money have you got? Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one. Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon? No. The last one, please. Is it Cartman's mom? Very funny! Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove? I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog. I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first. Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer. That's what we said. I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be. I suppose it is. And it's not only because the trip's a tough one -- Found it. Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight. Why not? Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel? Do you want this body? Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you. Take me now. I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets. We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives. But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there. Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle? ...Two... ...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo... Thrr... I was talking with someone! Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn. I thought maybe you just came for the ride. I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A. And if I don't? Then-you run. Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar. Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here. Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo. I know. Take two, three days. Call when you get there. Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way. You never talked to me like that - in all these years. And you never cried - I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died. Hi Loretta. Hi. It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports... Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible. I know that. That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa. We gotta ask Marty, of course. Sure. You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team? What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back? I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you! Looks like you're the one might go to pieces. Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here! How did she die?  I wanna know. You don't wanna know. Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think. She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night. Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character. I wish he was.  He's real enough. That one's for you. Thanks... I'll take it tonight. I can't. After the show. Laura?  Are you okay? I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye. Mrs. Redi, there's one thing  -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--? Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now. I didn't know. Yes    and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline. White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol. That's right. Dead. Dead? Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus. That's entrapment. No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers. Working late.  You're a damn fool. Oh, I know. What's the plan? Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius. So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera. There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill? You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it. Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children? The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two. Can you finish on schedule? In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied. You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing! So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get? You get to come alive again in the country! As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?! The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life! Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home. But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer! Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window? It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on! You could have warned him before you shut him off. Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy? I'm still not sure what you've accomplished. Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws. You're going too fast. But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way... How ya doin', Wade? What's goin' on there? Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there? Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet. No kiddin'? We might be innarested. No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal. Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman. Yah. 2:30. Pino, I work hard like everybody in here. He's right. So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze. I an' I, man. I an' I. You gotta go back there and talk to that guy. Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip. What expenses? Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on? You gotta go back out there. Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records. Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes? Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here? You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me. Look, I know it's hard to believe... So what's our problem? Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet. Oh? Have I seen it? I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately. I think you'd better. But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours. And what about you? A little melodramatic, don't you think. I have a flair for drama. Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room? You wanted an answer to your question. Annette? Thanks for the shirt. Whatever. Kevin, my father needs a doctor. He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out. If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that? Want some? No, fish is a PM food. Excuse me? Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type. How did they get our phone number? You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air. What about the wife? Clean. Check his kids. Clean. Nobody's got clean kids. We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work. If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control. You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months! What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it. But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that! The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am. Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me? Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line. You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out. Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it. Do you believe me? Yeah, I do. I want to believe you, too. What do you mean? Don't you ever get bored around here? Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins. They all know you? Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it? Why did you follow me yesterday? Excuse me? After the market, you followed me to the hotel. I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to. You felt obliged to. As the wife of one of our party. So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it? You asked to see me, ma'am? I want you to help my little girl. I'm only a student. Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane. I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh. Did he tell you about Georgina? I should kill you.							 * Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   * I'm sure. Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats. Do I know you? We've met before. Oh yeah, the insurance guy. Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex. Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now. Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great! ... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee. Shhh... Is there an ashtray in here? No. Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke. The voltage looks fine. Then check the connections. Any rotation? Yeah.  Two hours. Gravity? Point eight six.  We can walk on it. Don't even think about it. Why not? Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... If there was one. ... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to. Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?     Here, Doc. Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd! Hello, baby. Shut up. It's daddy. shithead. Hello, daddy. . my bourbon. Next week we work the park. I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail. You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens... Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here? I've missed you. Are you okay? Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us. Because ... I have to relax. I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight. Yeah, sure, a long time ago. Yes, it's been a long time ... One thing bothered me. I know, Hal is as stiff as always. No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror? I don't know, sir. One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I? Try it. No fucking way. Then think about it. Australia. What? I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there. Really? That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold. Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission? We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today. He can't reach us in here.  We're safe. I know. Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes. Good.  He never doubted you. The Don himself is coming to me tonight? Yes. We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone. One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio. What radio? The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound. Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come. They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up. You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties. The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen. Enough for everybody to breathe? Try again. Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this-- Open up! We hear you got a riot. Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you? Deputy sheriffs. Got a warrant? We don't need a warrant if it's a riot. Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself. What's your name, sailor ? Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir. Lance Johnson? The surfer? That's right, sir. I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical. Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain. As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties. ...excuse me. Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone. Do you know his number? No, I don't know... --I'm sure-- --I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum. Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business. Jack! I didn't like that. You should have told me who you were working for. Cyril didn't like it, either. Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it? He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in. See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth. Oh please. Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back. Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans. But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself? Why? Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death? Most certainly. And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them. That's a reasonable assumption. I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts. Doubts?  About what? About my love for her. They far enough? Sure -- fine -- There. Oh -- Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher. Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith. Goodbye, Miss Gallagher. Goodbye, Stew  Hello, Harold. Frances. Where's Clifford? He's not here. Oh. Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you. Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance. What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck. I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend? WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends. Oh, for Christ's sake  - I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to. Mm-hm. Screwgie. Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds. I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice... Remember how we were? Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can-- Why? To make sure she's all right. You must enjoy causing me pain! You shouldn't have pushed us! I think so. Well, thank goodness, that's settled. If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could? Meaning? He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek? Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked. Billy had alibis too. This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal. Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away. I've lost interest. He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me... Where are you going? I must meet my ship. Why can't we wait here for a ride? I feel better if I move. We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be. Curled up on the landing like love locked out! I did like the music. I carried you up to your bed. What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent. I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig. Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up. Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd. Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married. I begged him not to go. And he did. I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic. Mom, please. Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much... Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that. Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner. Yeah? You sure? Go. What happened here? The radio's on the fritz. Where'd you say Eric is? Somewhere along the pipeline. What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess. Sam?  We haven't seen him. Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz? Why? It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes. Roger. Huh? Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago? No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie. Louis-- Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it. Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you. Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'! I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura. Well what you reading it for? His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday. The day of our homicides. Yah. There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin. I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here. Thank you. Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself. Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night. Yes, I know. Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing. 10,000 M.S.L., Admiral. Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power. Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes. You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind? Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair. That a fact? Yeah.  It's a fact. No! Don't harm the vessel! It's Craig in there, I can tell. I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours. This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia. What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me. I need you to go to Miami. Not talk!  I said TALK!! I'm not your wife. The hell you're not. I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh! You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding? It was implanted by the Agency. And falling in love? Implanted. Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too? The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up. Bullshit. Push off toward us. Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there. My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast. Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young. And no AC. Fan works. Now what? Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work. Sailor? Yeah? This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life. Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes. What are the delusions like? So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters? That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see. Ray, where do you keep the glasses? Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired? Hi, Shari. Who's Shari? Who's -- Who's Ivy? What? You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy? I wish I knew. What do you want from me? I . I don't know. What do you want? Where's Sid? Damned if I know. She ditched me. You weren't supposed to leave her alone. I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together. What about that? I tried it. How about the thingy next to it? The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor... I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule. Okay, try it now.  All right.  Hey.     Whoo-hoo-hoo! Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound. You starting that again? Anybody cover? -- I was just trying to finish some work! You mean you've actually begun some? Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks? No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me. I thought I told you to move that truck! Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke? You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job. Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. Not here. Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you? Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone. What happened, Doolittle? Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it! What's bothering you, Madison? The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin. I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor. Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent. Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders? Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite. You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are. They give you copies to burn. Don't. I'm sorry. Hello? Hey. What are you doing? How are you? I'm fine. Who is this? Georgia. Hi....what....what's up....? It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok. Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on? I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey. I'm going to work. Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep? Not very late. You're going to work now? Yes. Can I ask you a question? Uh-huh. Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember? Yes. This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money. Me? Yeah. I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it. You don't even know how much it is. I know but I....how much is it? Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty? Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry. Really? Please? You have trouble, financial trouble? Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it. Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that. I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff.... Jesus Christ, what are you doing? So you got my mom's money. Will you be able to handle that...? Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes. ...you know that night we got hit... I... Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better. How'd they get onto you? How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...! Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection? Are you for real? You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number. ...SO...anybody special in your life? Do I look like I have someone special? Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation? I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson! Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions! Let's get something straight, Chappy! I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more. Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand? Hey, Bert. Wait a minute! I said we're leavin'. Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw. Hugh, I'm impressed.. Claire? Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time. Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything -- You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas. what? Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner. No, I'm not. I'm just really busy. I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to. What do you mean? What kind of person am I? What kind of person? No -- not as a rule. Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom. Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened. He said to follow him. Follow him where? Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end. I have to talk to you. Doug, this is Mr... I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could... Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect... You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more. Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo? I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good. Tactical! Inoperative. Raise the shields... Yeah, a long one. I've got lots of time. So do I. Thank you. I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream. Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution! I don't know if I'd go that far, sir. Why not? Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at. I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance. Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air! My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc. You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too. Print is dead. That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play? Is that a game? It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies? I collect spores, molds and fungus. Oh, that's very - unusual. I think it's the food of the future. Remind me not to go to lunch with you. Who's that? The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo. What's a King Pin? Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river. Which way? Right or left? Who knows? Right. Looks pretty shallow. What the hell do you want? I wanted to talk to you. The other guys - I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things - They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more. Shelly's already told me all about sex. She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly. I figured you did. Talley? I'm here. I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico. That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter. I'll give you these people. The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go? Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all. Who is that... ? The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much. You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do. Are you sure? Absolutely. Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? At this pace, it could be an evening wedding. Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast. I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness. Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed. We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey. I'm thinking Rizzo was right. Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre? Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe. They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle. Really? Did you play in a band? Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar. What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here. Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night. What? I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh. Follow me. ...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>? Show some compassion. Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect. Why's that? I don't know.  I don't know who I am. Yeah, well, welcome to the club. No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious. What?  Like amnesia? Look, go ahead...put the radio on... Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago? That's what I'm saying.  About time! Not yet... Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie. Should I slap him? Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman. That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open. Of course, Commendatore... Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...? I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings. I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note... ...yes. You have taken over his offices, is that not so? It is only temporary, until my confirmation by... Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo? Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. I'll have them picked up. Would you like me to take my pants off? If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear. Do you like the way I look? Yes. Do you think I'm pretty? Yes. Prettier than Ann? Different. Did you read the latest draft, by the way? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And? I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something. How about the new ending? Did you like that? Oh yeah. Much better. There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same. Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different. What? This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill. It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's. I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me. Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do? There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that. Klaatu barada nikto. Remember those words. I don't like it. Why not? I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic. He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner. Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and -- -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it. I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? Marion. It's a book. Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it. It's the truth. Without hope there's no point to anything. Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative. Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it. He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he? Won't worry about it. You go ahead. How come you stay 'round here? Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids. That's why you come back, huh? It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway. You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town. It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything. Scared, huh? Ray, maybe this isn't ... No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer. Marcia's living with a singer? Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met. What else? Say more. Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion. He is not going to kill the old man? No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black. First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs. I can't believe this. And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes. Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to... Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it. I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it. Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me. All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They... Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around. I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner. Come on, man. Not with the owners here. Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early... It's against my better Judgment... Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late? I've done all I could with the laser. All I'm asking is you test it beforehand! If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests. Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser. I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final! As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake. I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise. Leave him alone, Tim. Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas. Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too. Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals. Jeff! It's alright. It is? It will be fine. You have another. Just one. The back up. Could I have it, please. I can't get it out. It would take hours. That's alright. Just tear it apart. Tear it apart? Yes. Ahhh...Okay?!!! What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway? Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu. Lestat escaped the fire! He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead. Dad's disappeared! He was there and then he wasn't! Please don't make this personal -- Oh, I think you already have. Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready. Did you really believe we would give up our advantage? Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right. What do they--? Who are all those--? One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it? No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do? Great. I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it? Must have been tickled pink. Gee--I hope so. What's all this? Contributions from boys who read about your camp. Already? All these letters? Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country. Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here? Second drawer. Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight-- Not another bill? No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! Do you want to dictate them? The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted. Thanks a lot. Oh--*Saunders*! Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em. First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River. Georgia. No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town? Well... I might be going out to dinner. You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes? I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress? Philip!  We'll need shoes! Sheila... Stop... FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! Admit it. We're lost. All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time. It works, Poppy.  It works, it works! Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control. But, Poppy, you don't know what this means -- You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what. Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable. In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright. Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman? Nebbleman. ...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way... You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever. I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers... I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we? What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least? I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip? Yes. I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died. Died... Did you hear me? Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ... I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her. We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning. We own a small family grocery store. If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now. Oh God, I can't believe this. I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going. We're scattering the fucking ashes! Walter-- JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! Madam should sleep. I've done my hair differently -- do you like that? When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently. In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette. Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train. Goodnight, Suzette. My man Dubbs. Who are you?  What the fuck do you want? No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys. Don't worry. Thanks. Did you ever go back to see her? Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was. She probably died. Yeah, probably. Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you. I guess so. I never thought of it that way. It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her. I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed. You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it. Anything for art, eh, Paul? I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use. And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you? Yes, I suppose I do. Maybe I'll bring him some food by. Thank you for walking him. We! I've got the real thing! We've got Elvis! Aye sir, coding now. Dr. Marcus, it's your planet. No. Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge? At least kiss me when you do that. You just can't stop editing me. Huh? This is hysterical. ...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then... Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door. Okay? Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal. I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>. I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me. The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming. Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance? No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything. No, I don't. Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here. I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner? A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days. Stay here? Is that necessary? Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man. Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington. How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace. He's very intense, and internal, don't you think? At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor. Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...? No, Eve... I'm sorry. Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't! He couldn't have. Huh? The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception. Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't... Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father -- Then you remember more than I do. So, why did you bring this along? I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult! This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from. I'm not holding my breath in that department. Are you all right? Oh yeah. Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that? Sure.  Just like your men do. I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect. I knew he wouldn't come. I can't, I have to go home. You look like you've had quite a work-out. It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset. I know it, I know it. ... this doing hair it's... I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher. Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this. I hate this city. Wanna join your little friend? Where's Jesse? There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now. I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse! Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble. Yeah -- me. My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu. Just Klaatu. The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel-- Sit down, Mr. Harley. Good evening. How are you feeling? Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you? Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular. And you're sure it was a woman? God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know. The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had. Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist. By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow. No thanks. No, I mean it. So do I. We gotta go, Jack. No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go. This time you gotta go. I don't gotta go. You gotta go. Says who? Your older brother. You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore. Christ, Jack, it's her birthday. Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun. I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you. Go ahead. Stun me. I'm wery sorry, but -- Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down. I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel. Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink? No, thank you. Your majesty, I really think you... My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you... ... as always, majesty... ... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone. You okay? Yeah. You sure? Yes.  What's up? Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you? Bored. You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland. Hershe, you were in Cleveland? Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay. Okay, no problem. Okay thanks, atta girl. No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children. Your children? My dolls. We can pretend. Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct? Yes. If you had a... reprieve, what would do? Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted. And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>? All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way? The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe. Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights. The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed? Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure? Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven. Hmm.  Let's aim higher. Why is he acting so strangely? I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed. I didn't look like a bum. But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going. I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has. I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit. He's burning up. Total delirium. That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. Push 'em back. Help me! Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God. You cannot say that! No? Was Mozart a good man? God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know. All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him! My son, no one can speak for God. Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me! I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should. Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture. Feeling better? I just can't believe it. You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction. How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history. No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over. He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over. You're so sweet. If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup. Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens. Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours. Guess I'll get another Tecate. Si. Tecate. You like to fight? What? Fight. You know. I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her. Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles. -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand -- -- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back. Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you -- How much wine have you had? -- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you. You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again? No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone! That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to... Bates never denied Mary was here. Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money. Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it? Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing! Well...how do you feel? Ask me in about five minutes. Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve... How long, Scotty? 10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1. But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless. I knew those men better than you did -- Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then. So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had? No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine". Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage? What's the point?  Look at me. I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman. Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening. You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one? Guest? We have opened a restaurant... It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown-- What'd you do, honey? Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server... I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight. You look great. Well, let's hope it's all for the best. It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher - Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings. I'd work backstage or something? Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays. When do I get time for me? You don't. That's the point. Any group pictures in the annual? Nothing.  No mention of it. Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever. That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. And she waited here for him? Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes. Clear the bridge, Captain...? That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge. Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec... Michael!! Cal, my wife Judy. Nice to meet you. Who is that?!? What's in the box?? I don't know. He's not in the database - What's in the box, General?  What's in the box??? I thought you were someone else Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for? But how can you say that? They're mesmerising. Rum and ice, please. You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends. They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft. Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it! What are you doing, Herr Director? Taking out what you should never have put in. *                     Please tell me your name. Maria... Maria Mitchell. And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell. I'm starving...somebody, help. Got a half a tuna sandwich. Same one you had yesterday? I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink. What's going on? I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something. Leave me alone! Here we go! You've gotta be kidding me! Edie. I thought you might want some hot coffee. Thanks just the same. Well, it's over. But I feel like  My friends won't talk to me. Are you sure they're your friends? It's all right now, shhhh it's all right. Don't let them separate us. The deal. The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it? I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I... The Parkers seem like nice folks. They've been kind to me. Paden sends his best. I guess I put a good scare into him. [What's the PIN number?] [The what?] [The number you use at the bank machine.] [Four-seven-four-seven.] [Who killed her? You?] [No!] [Don't lie to me.] [The boss did or his brother.] [Who's the boss?] [We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...] Find the bird cage? Rache says it's from you. Well, don't make him disappear before I see him. I'd like to ask you a few more questions. I'd like to ask you some, too. No, Mother, he's lying... Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts No, sir. Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks. Nick! Give us a break... It's Ichiro.  Ich. Leave the rice cake outside and go home! Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you? Seriously? I'm doing all right? You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you. Beth, stop it! Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me. You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it. Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great. Who is that young man? That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something. This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table? This will do. I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be? Raw carrots and beets. Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow. Sheila? Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do. What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this. OK...it's open. Seen one like it before? Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes. Great. Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European. But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born. Do you like them? Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them? You wear them of course, silly. Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years. I know that. Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face. Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters. Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters! But you said you have the worst reputation. I do. Don't you want to change that? Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true. I think that's all the time we have for today. Same time next week? No. This is going to be our last session. Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you. Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help. Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault. You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you? Who said we were terrorists? Do you remember where it is? What? Where you lived with them. You're hot! So are you! I mean, you feel a little feverish. I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work? My shift ends at four, but I couldn't -- Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up. But what do I do? Look Jack I m late.  I d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails. You totaled it, huh? Yeah.  So sue me. Peter sends his regards. Oh?  How's he doing? Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director. Really?  Congratulations, by the way. I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year. President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...? Now exactly.  It's... complicated. No doubt. Ellie... Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi... You know why I'm here. It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now. Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt -- You can't just pull the plug, David. It's not like you've given me much choice. Meaning... Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines. I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening -- The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession. The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not. No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high. Goddamnit, they are out there, David -- Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then. David -- It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now. Recent hours have been a shock. Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king... Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it. There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother? The desire for vengeance... can be a poison. What is its antidote? I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it. Where are you going? Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English. Hop in. It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him. So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg. What are you giving me with the omelette? Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking. Joe - What? That's not a satisfactory answer. Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me. Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table. That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all? Getting drunk is no solution. Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room. You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place. What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit. I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife. He has a wife?! Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated. God, that's awful! It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head... Her 'head'?! You're making this up... No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia... Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy... No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds? There is very definitely a difference, Miss. They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by. Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started. That's thirty percent. For two lonely nights. I wasn't too over the top? No, it was the perfect level. Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good. Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport. Hey, excellent.  Thanks. Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me. I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much. No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one. You been here the whole time? I just caught the end. ... light. Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery -- My mom used to get PMS too. Used to? Did it stop finally? No, she died when I was twelve. I'm sorry. I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think. Oh my god, by wolves? Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty? Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it. I've got it!  Astounding! What? No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still. It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake-- --the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>! You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy. What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road. I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat. No! You want to come on in? He's a very stubborn man sometimes... You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles. Early, just think... Shut your mouth. Show me. Here? Now. Show now. Who is your friend? We met on the beach. Join us. Whaddaya got, Nolan? Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in. How long has she been dead? Six, eight hours tops. Any sign of rape? Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle. Carl's a jerk! He certainly drives like a jerk. He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK! I'll be right back. Just the missiles. They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles. Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock. Speed? Between Mach 3 and 4. Call them every five miles. Thirty-five, still straight. Fuck. Me. What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident? Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship! Aye!  Avast! That's just lovely. Thank you... All day. Can't stand light? Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>. You can see her? Yes. Holy shit... We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we? Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want! Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started -- Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap? Especially when I play the lead. Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer. We're not really interested, Henry. Ray, run faster. Okay. I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky. For what? You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again? What choice? If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register? Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit. Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much! If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me! Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching! I don't care!  I want to talk about it now! Theo. Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter. Yup. How 'bout a Cold Drink...? I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you. That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof. Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'... I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella. The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith. I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill-- So what are you up to now? I'm robbing this place. We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out... That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know... What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings? Something like that, yeah. Get back to the horses. They're straggling. He's learning his letters. Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country. I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up. As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice. That's a fine chick. Fine as May wine. Except she live on the hill and got a grandma. Make it too easy and it ain't no fun. Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down. Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house. Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense? Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door. May I offer you a drink? Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience. Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here. You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps? Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry? Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week. I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home. What did your wife get her? We got the same thing. Come on in. I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself. I think I'd like to dance. Why certainly, baby. Jake, what're you doin' here? Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately. What's it to you?! I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he? Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me. Those sluts! Yeah. But who's not a slut these days? I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow... Then get a goddamn snow blower! Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village -- And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself? It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much. Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with -- Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think... Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives... What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live! Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men? By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed. Joseph returns from the room where Gis le is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it. The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc. Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown. The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches L one's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again. Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires]. The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over L one. Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time? She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate? I'll do what I can. I'd better be getting back. Bye, love. pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek. Bye. Have a nice outing, you lot. Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose... Not now Bork. But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids. I didn't forget. You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it? Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on? Until your confirmation date. Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch? Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively... He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized-- He'll probably be getting a medical discharge-- Do you like my body? Sure I do. I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah. I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse. And you're worried about him. I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas. Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands! Out here.  On your knees. Damnit... <u>What</u>? I want you to follow Bud White. Even I'm not that crazy. It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently. Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor. Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night? Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone. You make a mistake? Yeah.  My whole life. I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got. Miles... Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young. We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer. Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it? It's right in front of us. Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name. Rafe -- I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me. Rafe... No.  You forgive me. Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice. That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It -- She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight? Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that? What? It's detonation cord, for a bomb. I don't know. Later. I don't know. Yes! To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke. To life. That's all there is. Believe me I know. Do you always punch people first thing in the morning? Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging. I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up! Two? Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a- Oh, I-I left it at your house. snow shovel or anything or something. I think I left it there, I'm sorry. You've got something to show me. Yes. Smells like a battle. Are you a warrior? The greatest swordsman that ever lived. Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'. Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose. I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house. Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative. All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension. I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out. Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do. Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home. You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out. Come on! Static! I may have seen her on campus. Not personally. No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about. It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen. The... Yes.  The ghost. I'm freezing Good night. And what's the occasion of this celebration? It's my birthday. And how many people will be attending this birthday party? I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us. Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go-- Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble. And what are you, his chaperone? Actually, I'm his father. Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here? Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call. We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good! I'm here. Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds. Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related? What? A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked-- Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this-- I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--! Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that? Oh shit... Fuck factor ten.  Been trying to figure out your secret. My secret? Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less... ...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do. And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think... ...like a fish. No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... ...is a perfect hunter. He's brains without ambition... ...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's... ...the master of his realm. How can we ever hope to win against the trout? There's only one way you can do it, Mason. Turn the power of the hunter against him. Tie a fly... ...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive... ...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite... ...back... ...and that power... ...without caution... ...is death. Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-... ...-to a simple thing like... ...fishin'. Some people might. Eeeeuuuww, gross. They're just fun to read. The Creator is that which created V'ger. Who is V'ger? V'ger is that which seeks the Creator. How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh? Growls a reserved greeting. Right. I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird. How well did you know Stacy and Rod? I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything. Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone? No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now. I want you to head right home after school. I will. Is that all? Here  What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You you had it pressed. Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time. Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? Listen, Brat I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself. There's nothing much to laugh at. And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed. You know, I really should take your card. Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker? Ahh. I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy. What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost? You will live.  Survive. Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment. You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod. Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost. Okay. What is it? Just some fatherly advice. Please. Will you help me? I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission. Mac, you really earned your wings this flight. My...wings... You told me that part already. Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and - Do you want to come to my apartment or not? I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception. Do you take American Express? You sure you won't come with me? And leave all this?  Not in a million. You know, you've been very nervous lately. I can't take this anymore. I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago. I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not. When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world. I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time. I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine. You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible. What? Another letter from your friend? This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her? I sincerely doubt it. Give me the fucking letter. Nothing's wrong with my skin. Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself. There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian. He was? Yes.  He admitted it. Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper. Why not? You know how they are... sex... Then just say he was sixty years old. Is that what it means? Of course. The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think... Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him. What's the matter with this kid? I feel fine--nothing wrong with me. Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you? I can't quite make out -- Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look. But I saw what it was. It's the little deer. Well, that fella today, you shot him alright. H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'... You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. Interesting theory. What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product. Child pornography. There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one. Snuff films. I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing. What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see? First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is. Rise...and...shine...! You re jumping, sweetheart... ...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem. It sounds exciting. Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it. Ahh, nothing. I could swear I heard... Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock. Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012. How many storage areas are there? They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display. He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things. Like what? Evelyn... Get up... NOW! Steven?? We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients. Thank you, ma'am... I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head. Come on. No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all. I like you too. What is it, Miss Vivian? Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there? It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say. Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal? I think you'll find it normal enough. Will I like it? You'll like it fine. Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best. I want our boy back. Oui. That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous. We still have you and I. I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back. Where do we look for little lost Puff? I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape. That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No? You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes! You do know how to drive? I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick. Want a lesson? Wait. What did you say? Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything. I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled -- My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now. You never thought of the possibility? Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me! You love her, don't you, Max? Don't you? This should take care of Mother. Take the whole lot. I won't need it. I told you not to talk that way -- Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking -- Stop it -- It's...42 56 76 . 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast. Doug, I can't just leave you! You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay. What's a'matter? Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions. How much? $20. Let's go to the movies...on you. The girl. The girl has the disc I need. I told you, I don't play well with others. Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file. You okay? Great. Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree. That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money. And God love you for it. ... which I hope will make you very happy. Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell. Farewell? Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday. But you're not going anywhere, are you? Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight. They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants. And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you. I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen. You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days. Lloyd, what happened...? Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical- Margo, again... And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with- That's on time for Margo. Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy- It's just possible she didn't... Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant- - don't run out of adjectives, dear. - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing... Margo hasn't done badly by it. Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves? You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing. Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know. Need any help? To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve? Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong. But-- It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express. What about you? What?? Look at your reflection in the mirror!! Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins... Bastards! Stop! Who? Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him. I don't know who that is. What did you come back for? Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'. Are you alright? Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy. But Justin... I'll get him. Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord. Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way. That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it. No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map. Or in the slammer. Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth? Waynette! I cannot stay. Why not? I'm leaving in the morning. I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun. And now? And now I want you. You always get what you want? I don't know yet. Seven minutes! It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think? Six! How 'bout some Cokes? Cost ya a buck. This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes. What? I thought I saw... It looks like a branch. Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice. Why not? They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn. What's going on, my friend? You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what? He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you. Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of. What sort of puppy are you looking for? What sort have you got? Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand? Yeah. We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand? Yes... Good, good... So, what are you looking for? What about an untrained pup, white... How much of a hurry are you in? Tomorrow? I m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases... I see. How much? Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient. ... Fine. I ll go for the safe place. Have the money ready by 11am. We ll call you. It's late, they're closing... Don't worry about it. I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters. Let's go. - it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say- Where'd you get all that information? Eve. Eve? She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her... That was a pity... She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo... I wonder why. Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song. We're on the move. C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk! Has he hurt you? His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all. I've told you a lot of private stuff. I can tell you anything else. What about everything? How did this happen? You should watch what you eat. Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar? I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds. And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck? Who you calling dumb, dickless? You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow. I'm not voting for you. Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom. A nun? I'm telling you! You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket? Huh? Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there. I'll never meet the man of my dreams. You and the other 99% of the women in the world. Something's wrong here. Gee.  You really think? Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why? I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?. Why did Mikey leave Nazca? And what's this ... ? What? You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time. I might. That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper. Who's in the car? That's Applejack. You want to meet him? Sure. Hing, hang, hung. You better not sing that song. Why? Cause you're too little. Before we do this. We're doing something -- ? Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list. You dumbshit! What'd I do? You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing. I've talked to your father. That's what I mean. You'll put your clothes here. There's no mirror. There's not. Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is. Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff? I'm choking on it. Who is it? What do we do? Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys. Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall -- Levi? Who names their kid Levi -- Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio. Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone -- Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar. He's in interrogation? Yes. Move him. Why? Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute? Excuse me? Is Dunbar cute? That is the most unprofessional -- Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute? Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk. I know, I just want to give him a thrill. You smell that? It's coming.  Run. Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park... National? Yes. Percy Warner Park'. Yeah. He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks. Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that. Why did you come here, Grady? And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B... Thank you. I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room. I think he's moved... I, uh...  Um... Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you? Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day? No, I didn't. Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go. Do you have any idea what triggered this concern? Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening? Ann, do you see a pattern here? What do you mean? Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem. Yeah, so? If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over. Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke. What, leave you alone so he can cap you? I'm okay, you go. Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit. Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years. What the hell is going on here? And what's that? My business? Yes. Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison. You killed him? Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now? I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now. Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay. They're okay. You alone, or you got confederates? I'm not alone. How many you got in there? I got Sal. Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore? Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand? Tell him we gotta go. Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it. My prop guy, had a guy out here. Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.? It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it. You're wrong. Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends? They have Lyssa! You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly! Well? I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell. Are you crazy?! I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon. Don't! It's a fire fight. Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on. None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive? A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it. But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there? Yeah. But not with the Cong. Who then? Why don't you call me up tonight? Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant. Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it? It's down the hall. I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all. If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas? Fly. He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy. What? Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that. That'll be all, boys. You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname? It's over for you. Take your shirt off. Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of. They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so. Well, it shows imagination, anyhow. I wonder if you don't resent that in her? I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child. What kind of clothes was he wearing? A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it. Tell 'em. When are you going back? I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me? What? I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm. I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later. It'll have to be sex, then. Victor, your scar -- I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to -- Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care. Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz? I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him. I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key. Let me have it. My God. Now listen to me very carefully. I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it! More!  More! She wants it to come. Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY He ain't here right now. He leave town? He's around. Give me his home number. I'll give you his beeper. I'm gonna be your typist for this evening. Oh, God... And here's some hydrogen peroxide. I don't drink. It's for your finger. One moment. --has any of them got an ax?-- --political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?-- Thank you. Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. What are you doing here? Checking up on my friend, Harry. Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up. Isn't it enough that I can love you? Mmm... Hmm? ...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. Okay. Be careful. You too. You were gone a long time. Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila. So he's doing okay? Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs. That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey? Shit. And what did you do tonight, honey? I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila. And what did you do tonight, honey? I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did. Do you know what I gave up to be with you? Yes. I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair! Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing. How the hell would you know anything about the human heart? Lila... I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago. She looks a lot like you. She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show. Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation? I don't notice anyone else complaining. I got it myself... I couldn't wait. Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it? I'll do it. It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out. It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM. Why so few? Faith. Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you? What happened to the people who used to live here? Uh oh.  I remember that temper. Daniel, I didn't hear you come down... Check. Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary. Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now? Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you. All I need is the radio frequency to track them. What are you talking about? I'm coming with you. You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century. What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales... I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>. All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz. Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty. No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means. Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful. Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses. You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie? C'mere. John -- I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it. You talked to Jack? Not since last night. He took a guy hunting. The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental. Jack? The other guy. Where... how'd you hear that? CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow? No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go. Anything? All in Norwegian. When you go, I go. That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering. ...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine. Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad? No -- I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time. Closer than that. Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s. But would we get the phones back? Yeah, again, in  theory, but - - Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray. That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue? What happened with Rick? We'll discuss it later. Is this supposed to be an apology? It s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings-- You brought the money? Right here. Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night. No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning? RUDOLF! What news? The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army. Is that why the Assembly was convened? Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money. And the Governor? He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body. Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence. About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them. I was the kids' godfather. And...? And" what? I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"... Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now. Let me be the judge of that, Madam. Yes. Well. She's upstairs. What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life? Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here... He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed. He's not making light. I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down. All damn. Just hold your breath. It's Germans! Kill the bastards! Sure. Oh great, I ran out. If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it! Ike, you could make a song outta that! Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there. You mean he's not a criminal? Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy. What are you doing here? I heard there was a poetry reading. You 're so -- Pleasant? It's starting to swell, is it painful? Yes. Aahhh...  So what color is it? What? The LeSabre! Maroon.  I stole it. What? He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it. Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive! Yeah, me too. Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday... I gotta go make dinner. I'll go with you. No way. I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere. I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want. Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here. Really?  So, what is this, a party? Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it. Yeah.  I better get on with my work. Yeah, he told me. Personally? Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month. What Get Away jet? It was in the Herald. Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife. Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway. Who did this? Stu. That was right about the time we met. When he first came in to the sleep lab? Yeah...before your time. I haven't had a crush since I was When did you start smoking? Sure I got boots. I got boots right here. Then lemme have 'em. No. No!!!? No. What do you mean, no??? That's it. No. No way. Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle! You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own! He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly. Who told you this? You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it. Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer. Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist. Counselor Troi, report to the bridge. Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark. Agreed. My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol... It'll be over soon.  I can get you money. Don't come back, either. Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's. Where's the Keymaster? Oh, shit! And Baaaaaaa! back on you. If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right. All right... where did you see her? She's in my biology class. Did you get her number? No. Did you get her name? No. It's too soon. It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes. Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me? I would. Yeah. Really? I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her. You tell me, Mike. What do I do? Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do. Where'd he come from? I don't know. He just appeared as magic. Well, don't just sit there, shoot him. Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me... Oh yeah... Oh yeah... Oh Sara... Anna... Anna... You're the doctor, what do you think? She seems very unhappy. Do you want to come to my apartment or not? I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception. Do you take American Express? By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight. You always know the right thing to say. It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not. So? So, that occurred to me. Hey Deb... can you hear me? Barely. I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one? What? I'm scared, mama. Why, honey? Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair. Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all. He's been gone a long time. Who? Paul's grandfather. Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go? Down the ... er ... Oh, down the ... er ...? Yeah, down the ... er ... Well, give a couple of minutes ... Where'd she go? Maybe she turned. You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it? I'm waiting till the time's right. I saw your girl yesterday. I don't have a girl. No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste? Please! Yes... I'll give you that. Thank you, Sera. Do you want me not to go tonight? No... we already talked about that. ...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that. I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter. Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here. I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah... What? She used a baster. Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she? She lives her own life in New Jersey, America. You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives. He's insane! We should follow him home. Seems a shame! The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day. What'd the Prosecutor say? It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry. Did you ask for bail? Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him. The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me. You should stay. I don't know. Where's your dad? He jumped into the ocean. Tell him I said "hi". Little high. C'mon big 'un, you're okay... Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have. Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it. Go away -- please. That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks -- Like all this. I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom. I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash. I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere... What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want. I can't talk right now. What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand? No...look I'm busy... Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece - I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere! Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me? Can't you see I'm busy here? English. I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street. Sure! Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something? Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father. No problem, is it at your place? Yeah. I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting. I'll always go back to that church. So one day we'll meet. Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch. Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really. Watch out!! Keep firing! What are you doing? I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight. But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water? Fight it. But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency? Then pull the emergency brake! There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie. Yeah. Where the hell is my car? I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself. I do. Every day. Erin knows, doesn't she? Fill her up? No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine. Are you all right, Dad? Sure ... fine. I used to play ball. Yeah? Drafted by the Red Sox. You played for the Sox? Double A. New Britain. Oh. Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk. Really. They said. Hmm. The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck. What happened? Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm. I think we went the wrong way. Oh, you think? Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she? Yes. So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect? So what's the problem? Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh... I can t stay here. You re not going to. What's so exciting? It's not too far away now. I'm scared. So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now. We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room. You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train? When they find it, they find it. It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it. If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason. I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf  de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill. For you. You shouldn't have. I'm sorry. What? Snap out of it! Interesting. I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar. Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand. I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights. Wild doesn't exactly cover it. But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand. I wouldn't bet on that. I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought. Look, snap out of it, will ya? Kiss me. Tell me about the kids. You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting... But nightmares are the common thread? Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep. Anything? We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake. Oh God. Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat. I wouldn't be so sure they haven't. What's that supposed to mean? I think you better put that away. I think you're right. She lived alone. She must have known someone. Are you sick, Mama? No, Estellita. Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession? Later. When I finish the ironing. Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ? We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ? He's been expecting you. I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up? Where is it? On that chair in the hall. I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt. I've had a letter from her. They've moved house. Where to? Hi Loretta. Hi. Yes, thank you, Doctor. I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic? What? Could we have intercourse? I made your bed this afternoon. Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon? You shut your mouth you son of a bitch! Dwayne put the gun down -- Shut up!!!  Slut!!! I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent. And where exactly does that put your position...? I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive. It s a glimpse, Jacko. I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse! Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of  em take a couple seconds...  ...some of  em take a lot longer... I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?! What are you working on? Just a little experiment. That would mean they'd been trapped in there-- --for three hundred years. How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years. Not unless they're immortal. It's one way. We're only going one way. Mother! If your father were here... That was big of him. Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate. That's great. So how're you doing? Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse. So what's happening with your book? Universally rejected. Strike three. Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do? Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy. I am. Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess. I guess. Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them? Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them. We forgive each other then? No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying. Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay? I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide. I'm willing to take that risk. I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense -- Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there -- And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime -- You're -- Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time. What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks. I disagree. Then disagree but don't stand in my way! Shouldn't we pull over? No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway. Where did you get those from, a museum? Nick the Greek. Fuck!  We did it! Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck! It's regular. Okay? I could stand something regular. His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you. Why should I want to meet him. Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales. What's my end? You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man. Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...? It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City... Let me call you back... The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened? Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. Like a New Year's Day hangover. He needs to be turned over. You are perfectly healthy. That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms. Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today? Yes. Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you! How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III? That's right. I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim? You could say that. Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that. Are you worried about tomorrow night? Not really. Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat. I don't blame him. Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other. It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face? Maybe because you're looking her in the face. I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie. The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot. My husband's at the office. Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando. That's not his apartment. Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk. Put that down! No. I'll put this right through your head. You worked out well. You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children... Let me tell you something about Patty. Who's "Patty. Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe. I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin? When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced. What's that one, there? Tattoo. Had it taken off. Will I believe you when you tell me something? There's nothing left for me to lie about. So that means it's alright for you to act like that? What'd you do? You okay -- ? I'm cool. I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary. Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif... You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't. What's his name? 1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall. No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85. I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway. Seltzer? Want some? That's it!  Up ahead! Where does it lead? The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building! That is the racket Harry Lime organized. Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence. What happened? Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle. Where were you guys? Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart. Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man. Well ain't that a kick in the head! Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York   hopefully our numbers are growing   who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths   not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did... Did I get you up? No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face. Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice. Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass. Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet. By pulling my hair?! I was all out of dynamite! The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble. You always did have more balls than brains. And they got Penny!  Look! Don't shoot! That means the nanobot is still inside him. Yes. What would happen if I threw him into the core? The same thing I suppose. He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer! Just tell a little white lie? What did you say? I said... France is your enemy. Not ours. Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony? First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands... Will you men help us stop the French? ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes? I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined. It's a brand new card. Maybe it's not connected yet. Here, you can use this. K-Kay, M-Mack! Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand... Mulholland Drive. Figures. So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit? None of your business. Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied. That what you think? Holy shit... We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we? Well! That is, if it's all right with you. And if it isn't? Absolutely.  Good idea. With those camera lights and... He's going with you, Doctor. No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out. And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it! But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves. Okay.  Good idea.  You first. [You only fuck me to get information.] [You only give information so you can fuck me.] [A beautiful circle.] I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it. We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready? You really look better. Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone... You have nice red in your cheeks now. Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is? Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off? How about a check? Whatever's right. Scotch and plain water, I think. Warm water, no doubt. What are you an idiot! The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed. The University cannot do this. Is the room safe? Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building. What do you think? You fucked it? What are you doin'? I'm getting out of here. What do you think? Lemme have the bag. Fuck you. I can carry it. -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail -- Let's talk about -- I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did. It's fine.  I can bleep it out. I warned you -- I get on a roll... -- let's talk more about your background -- Muffy -- coffee? Well... THIS. You wrote his scripts for him? Well, the basic ideas were frequently his- You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his   what about before that? Before what? Before Bill came to Hollywood. Now, did you remember that, or... Nope.  Just filling in the blanks. Oh.  Okay. Are you frightened? Why should I be? She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else? On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew. Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut. Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart. We goin' in? Gun out and up. You got a prob-... ...-lem too? No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.  Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though. Promise me it'll always be like that. Like what? When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything. Um... okay. What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona? How does a nice mature fuck sound? Houdini's sick. Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight. What happened to you Flash? Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this. I know but let's hear it anyway. I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth. I don't understand what's going on. There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith... But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest. You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie. Yes, I know. The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford. So what? Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother Yes. Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous? He's pretty... remarkable. You didn't... get it on with him? Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter. Reporters don't have hormones? Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones. I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters. That's not fair. No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend. Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men! Jeanne, look behind you. Never look behind -- only ahead! What was your relationship with STEPHANIE? It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me... She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming. Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic. No. No one knows you're here? No.  I had to talk to you. You had to do _nothing_! You're wrong. You're a fool. Maybe. Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop. You okay? Just fine. What's the weather like? God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'. Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred? Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed. Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team. What?! Why don't you start with that? Yes, sir. You're dismissed, Private. Thank you, sir. Oh, no! Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is! Danny?!  Danny! Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and -- Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort. He is that. I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck. Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there. Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days. I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left. What are you doing, Plank? What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate. Lock the door behind you. Where is he? Where he always is. Jim -- what's wrong?! You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill! Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber. You don't understand anything. I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously. But you know how to drive? Sure. Got a license?  But no car? Don't need it. I just got my license two weeks ago. You're good. I been drivin' since I was twelve. That would explain it. Can you help Mom? I'm trying. Got to. There's nothing between Will and me. Yet. Nothing yet. Far out.  Where are my glasses? They broke when you fell. Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair! Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses. What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see. When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it. Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription. It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit. If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal. Even if we do, it might be too late. I'm afraid you've got to. I'll be all right. You're my brave boy. Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week. I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle? Yes, thank you. How are the kids? Well, thank you, they asked for you all week. I got surprises for everybody! Bought at the airport. This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line. You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else. I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life .. I've heard you call him Freddy. You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>. You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you. I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience. Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract. If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger... No... It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?... ...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer. Who? No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum... That sound good, boss. ... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid... I like your style, master.  How do we get him here? There's only one way. I'll bet it's a doozy. I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face... I am sorry... H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me! Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention. In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery! Savagery is what monkeys understand. You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say? You will regret this. What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it? Your concern is heartwarming. It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you. Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside? His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed. How much did you have? A hundred grams. It's not fair! When we backed you-- When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks-- Why not? It kept going off for some reason. False alarms. That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting! Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that? I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop. You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window -- Spaceship of some kind. Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece. Uh -- Yes? -- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose. What are you saying, that it's time to go? That was the damndest thing I ever saw. What made it... It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding... ...Why? Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son. My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name? Karl's my name. You tell us about America. How do you know I come from America? We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot. Only the son of a Pezzonovanta. Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say? Yes. Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light... Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions. Thanks for the advice Dave. Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her. You wanna talk to her alone? Yeah. What would your girlfriend think of that? I don't have a girlfriend. My point exactly. I'm serious here. So am I. C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently. You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building? You know what I'm saying here. Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous. You <u>were</u>? Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you. Uh, you first. C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work. Okay. I'll go right after you. Well... yes, quite possibly. Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you? Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I-- Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you? A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through? Put it on. Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert? What? It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this... You heard him.  I'm a star! Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five. I'm the greatest star of them all. Goodbye.  Norma. No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star. The winds are picking up. On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park? Sixty-two thousand - That looks pretty nice. Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed. Are you O.K.? It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get. Stay here, I'll see what I can do. No women allowed. I am an English woman. About a year ago. He dropped Jimmy off first? Yeah. And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there? No. So you were alone. Yes. Did he come in with you? I guess. You told a lie and got on a plane. That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am. Okay.  Good.  Goodbye. Becky? What? Is this crazy? No.  That's the weirdest part about it. Thank you.  I love you. I love you, too. Good night. Good morning Madame. Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps. Rats? Uh huh. 'Fraid so. Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... Let me see what I can do. So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked. I finished it. Good for you. Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good. Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit. One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started? You've been there? Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out. You believe that? You think bad, and bad is what you get. That's a good piece of advice, Darrell. No charge. Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll-- Two-hundred. What? It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars. You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty. Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty. I didn't tell you to replace any gasket. Yeah, but it was shot. I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work. Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign. What sign? The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation. What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick. Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me. Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car. Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>. I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name? Joad. Tom Joad. How many of you? I always wondered what happened with us. I haven t thought about that in years. That was lovely! You know you almost got us both Killed back there? Fun though, wasn't it? You'd die for fun? Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed. I laugh sometimes Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy? Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean. You're a little touchy about it. I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy? Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife? What about her? Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life? Where do you get these questions? Just answer. I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know. Doesn't suit you. How would you know? Just doesn't, that's all. Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven? Room service. Yes, you're right, I don't understand. Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me. Dinoine chagantakat! Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better. What the - ? How did you - ? Emergency procedures. Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else. Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on? Oh, nuthin'. The Penny Saver sucks. Yeah, but it sucks for free. Baby, I'll call you tomorrow. What for? I ain't white and I don't put out. She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously. The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement? Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't! But you had! Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow. I think so too. I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl. So it's love which drags you to Moscow. Yes! No visa. I must get into that country of yours! Oh no. No visa. That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa... You're going to force us... huh? Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out! Why should I take a chance? On what? How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory? What for... why? Or a tunnel or a bridge... Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country.... You killed her. I saw it. Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy? Where's Mitch? Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm. Why? Didn't Al believe my story? He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner. Then he saw. He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police. What good will they do? This painting isn't the original, is it? Yes, I think that one may be. You ever wear one of these? I don't ski. Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around. I'm not making any promises. We'll turn back anytime you want. Oh boy... this should be interesting. What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off? Vecchio. Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze? Yeah. You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her? Bits and pieces. She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him. And what about your own hand? No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking? It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men. Oh, yeah? Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie. And how do you bluff yourself? Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men. Except this time, the mission IS a man. That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again. John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up. I think you're right, Keith. You want me to take over? All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right? Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley? I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way... We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out. Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock. Fuck off! You told me to get you up, asshole. I brought a few of my own. Someone stop her! We should head Northeast. Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi. There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down. It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against. You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast. I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am. Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out? ...I can't do it, Wally... Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said? What? Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he... ...I... Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage. There was some trouble here   the villagers on the mainland  -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here   broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves. All the graves? I'm afraid so. There were rumors   people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions. I donut understand. Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask. Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie? Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced. Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town. Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church. Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester! Richie? You okay? I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us! Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates. I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning. Cheese is particularly troublesome. Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip? Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that? Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio. Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner. What? Just do it!  Meet me there, now. You still want to be transferred to the other paper? Yes. Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is. You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix. Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over. You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head... Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!? So why this ? Excuse me ? Why did you build this whole place ? Is this really the time ? Do you have something better to talk about ? I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me. He hired you to build this place ? I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships. I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears. Oh. Okay. I gotcha. Are you all right? Oh yeah. Don't waste my time. Very well, it's your ass. Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack. It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance. Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it. I was afraid that might happen. Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives. There's only one alternative to the serum. Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment. That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe. I hate the environment. Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner. And where might that be? I was thinking, Antigua, maybe. I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you. I'd like that. Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it. Like how? Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke... Mild stroke? Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon. Up and around?  Soon? Soon. I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?! ...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on... Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished. You're thinking...? Who knows. This isn't in our database? I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away. Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command. Onscreen. What? You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks. Hi. Hold it right there. I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains. Sir, please try to hold still. So, I guess it worked. Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten? Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning. Excuse me, fella. ...did they... Would you excuse us, please...? Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me... Did you sleep well? Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep. I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ... What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature! Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money... Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater... But I was only trying to be friendly... Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job. Okay, okay... I won't say a word... This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon. Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth. Thank you, Captain. Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets? You okay? Yeah. You don't look so okay. I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house. It is not.  Get out. I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color. Get out. Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ? I'm up against a deadline. Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow. That's my point!! ...and the tape will be running. Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor. Such the flirt. U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation. I can't move! Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can! Delongpre, you don't even know me. I know you. Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents. Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers. Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that. Elena!...But when... I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here... Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing? Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you. You'd better.  I'm very angry. I'm pretty busy, as you can see... That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you? Yes, I did. Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants. What assistant? Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole. Gordon Cole? And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times. Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable. Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars. Here's to Ed.  For making us into something. You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day. Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great. Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk! I'll get if for you. No! No. Heh. I'll be right back. So it's like you want to be secret friends. That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind -- Then maybe you can read mine. Why do I have to do this? You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film. It was hot! No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough. I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you. You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room. Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds? Yes. Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him? Yes! Are these the articles? Yes! Were you present when all these things took place? Yes! Are they true! NO!! But they did take place? They're colored! Just to make him look silly! And you saw them happen? Yes, but I  That's all, Miss Bennett. It isn't all! I'd like to explain  That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all. D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog? No. Lotta scratch-marks on your door? Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something? Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess? Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates . Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica. Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement. Oh, good.  Something new and different for us. What? Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place. Like this place? I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton. Good woman.  I trained her right. Daddy, she's younger than me. My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic. You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you. I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much. You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them. Boy, are you gonna get it. My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last. Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*. Ring the call to quorum. Please. Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places. I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know. It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop. Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel. Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey? I didn't count the days. Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out. Queer. What did you say? Dad said it first. How long does Doug take? I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes. What's Doug do in Chicago? He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him. A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block. Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider? Who? You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner. What did you do to your hair? My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut. It's nice. Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena. My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me. We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere. I thought you were against fighting. What do you say we go for a walk, pal. Get your hand off me. Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about. Go fuck yourself. You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace? I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you. It's chow, Animal! Chow! Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there! No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on! I don't care if they wear galoshes! You want Betty Grable! Let me go! Betty Grable! It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes. Does Alyssa know? Nothing. You got any weed? You got the money? What are you wearing? I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window? Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry. You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America! Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story. Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'? Well, Annie, your place or mine? You got me all confused. A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing-- I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman. No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient... Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth. Michael, give us a lift. OK, get in. Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me. No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out. D'you think we should do something? Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son? One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs. When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades. Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us. If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance. Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way. Brilliant, Admiral. A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war. --the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs. And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune! No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry? Qu est-ce que tu veux? Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr - pubescents. I go in alone. You don't get the Mask code unless I go. What're you doing? We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look. Not now.  I'm cold. Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What? So I have to have a motive to be with you? You tell me. You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that? Answer the question, Patrick Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company. Nice to be here. That feeling won't last long. What if I couldn't get to you? I was scared of what you were gonna do. When I found you? If I didn't go. Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid? No. I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you? No. I m calling about the puppies. Have we done business before? I saw the ad at George s.  I m passing through town and I m in a hurry. May I have your phone number? Why? This is a bad line. A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious? No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten. Why isn't he in the General Ward, then? Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking. Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable? Yes sir. What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point. Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional. Oh, is he a friend of yours? No, more of an acquaintance. Smokey Huh? Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul. Bullshit.  Eight, Dude. Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame. Bullshit. Walter! This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules. Yes. I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through. I'm going to the market. If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want. Whose orders are these? Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. Pretty much what you'd expect. That's what I thought. Do you know what the Little People just told me? The Little People? They said you're The One. I'm the one what? <u>Oh shut up</u>!!! Spock... Did braking thrusters fire? They did, Admiral. Then... Where the hell are we? Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe? Send for Goebbels. All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation -- You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself. Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died. How about the cop? Dennis?  I want you to release those people. Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away. We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you. I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them! Did you talk to Paul? Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door. We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key? He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice. What was it? He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon. It's a sign -- It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk. Why not? He's my brother. You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy. He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born? I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment. I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us. But you will always be here? Me? You will always! I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming. .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire. You're part of the mining guild then? Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial. The Jacket. That's what they call it, right? Yeah. It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients... Hey. Are you lost? Nope - just came by to chat We don't chat. Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested. We're not. Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk. Some champagne, Miss Flaemm? You may go, Mr. Kringelein. Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing? What is this insolence? Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man. Go away -- go away. Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna? I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ. Of course.  How is the old boy these days? Something round, two wires ... That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait... What's wrong? Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe. Make up your mind, trigger. Hey Wendy. Hey Sandy. Mikey was looking for you. Yeah? See ya. This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical. What kind of a car is it? You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle? What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice". You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you! Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title. Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign. The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ... At-at-at-at-at. Knock it off! Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts. Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing? I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. No you're not. You visiting? Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company. Who's this guy I always see her around? Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny. So...how's the knee? Getting there. Strong enough to get you down the aisle? Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you... That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy. Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us. I don't know who we are anymore. He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet. He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit... So what? So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak. They still have to take it to a jury. How's work? Well, same ol' same ol'. I think you better sit down I don't want to sit I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter? Doesn't sound very exciting. Don't make yourself sick. Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner. Talk to him. I will. But I must find the right moment. Did you see the moon last night? Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something? Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here? What do you mean? You have no idea what's going on. No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you. Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place. This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time? Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg. You -- you know about me and Dan? I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go! I'm here, I've got you... I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen... You don't think... They'll be here. Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the... I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos? Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are. I think they got me. They got the bull-fiddle. You don't see any blood? Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O. Connect to public access. Access established. Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement. Uplink selected. Johnny?  Did you see Ben? Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world. Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"? At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project. Do you care if I sit down out here? No. Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now. Right here, sir. Didn't realize you were watching the clock. I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. Nah.  Don't sweat it. Quincy... For real.  I should be alone, anyway. Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion. Oh dear. I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and - Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot. Where's the car? Outside in the visitors, car park. What!? They brought the car here? My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station. Have you seen it? The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive. It's about time. It is? After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident. There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding. Who is he? He's my younger brother. You have a brother? We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it? Sure. Need some help? Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker. What about O-2? Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using. The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours. I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them. Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side. Objection!  Speculation. I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy! In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn. The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think. Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. -- Fuck her! Come on, let's go. Jeff! Let's go! For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down. Stand...? Retire. Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor? You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie? You wanna drink? No. You? What's it so hot in here for? I'm pinned to the panel. Time to go. I can't eject. I don't know.  How long before it kills us? Five seconds. What is it?  What's the matter? Mike's out there. Why are you doing this? No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you... Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses! Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river! I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station. You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful. Really? Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable. It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that. You killed them. Well, that's a relief.  Thank you. No... no problem. I wish I could return the favor. Yeah, Roz. Any sign of our friend? Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput? Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away. Is she a Capulet? His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy. Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?! Eve?! Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal. Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet. The bearer of bad news. We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead. So... hi there. I don't believe we have anything to say to each other. Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen! If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing? Yorgi asked me to. You do everything Yorgi says? Go to hell. It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that? Mind your business. Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you. She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting. Yeah. Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms. Yeah. Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want... Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas. You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had? You called the doctor, huh? Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you. Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here? Mostly Tammy fans See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register. He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more. But, they were there I counted 803 votes. It happens, Larry. People make mistakes. I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down Where we headed? You'll see. I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before. He pissed me off. Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus... Make a bridge out of her. Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone? Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days? Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we? I want you to turn this into a silver bullet. You're not going to let it go, are you? I saw what I saw. Marty, the moon wasn't even full! ...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up... What? They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was. ...What are they doin' right now...? He must have been great-looking, right? Why do you say that? Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom. ...we had to lick his boots clean. He was your snitch. Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars. And one good guy. We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need. How's that? He works for Gillette. We pay better. C-18. That's the magic number. He's a very shy boy... What? Something Lecktor said. Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh... It's not over yet. It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight. DeLa - what's the matter with you. You ain't happy about the green light? You're helping Rajeev? No.  Rajeev's in India. Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution? Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood? And who is this? Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR. You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already! Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose. And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right! Looks good. One thousand volts.  Should be enough. You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ? Something like that - Jack? Marcie? Hey, guys! You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em. But not you. Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing? All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money. The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like. Sure, he agreed quickly. By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai? Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got. No doubt you've heard the rumors. I take no account of gossip, Your Highness. My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy. Of course. I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble. I see. I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops. A situation? I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party. I'm flattered you think so. I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni. Quite. We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first. Right. But HOW? I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try. That's right. What? Albatross? Yeah. Rick March.  Who the hell are you? Gieg, Chuck. Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat. Whatever. Yeah. You must have a bible in here, don't cha? Yeah, we got a bible. Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please? I'm not asking you to swear to anything. I don't want you to wait for me. That's something you can't decide. She came a long way to visit me, didn't she? I guess she did. Aces full. And me coming in with two pair-- Machismo? Somebody find him a knife. Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen. Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea? I want to experience childbirth. With a, with a stranger?  With a-- Just think about it.  That's all I ask. I want to stay. I said come on! He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why? Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid? Right.  Here!  c-4. Well, what's the point of waiting? I agree. I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well. What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that? What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood? Why would I do that? Hey, what're you doing here? Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt. Stop! Stop! Let her carry this shit inside. That's who you are too, Emma. Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember. I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light. Praetor Shinzon? No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help. You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly. Just. Like. Jason. Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here. Goodbye and thanks. I don't like to see you go. Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later. This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it! A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right? Why?  Where are you going? Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me? You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. I have? ...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out. I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times. I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... I don't understand you. What is the problem? I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things. That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation. I'm paying you. Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure - I don't want it. The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens. How do you survive? Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables. Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you? No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public. Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room? Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down. You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win. Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again. Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved. Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk. We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN. They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution. Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading. Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley? I told you, he isn't here. Out for the evening? He's in Florida.  Palm Beach. When's he due back? I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that? I thought I should check our emergency transmitters. Have you got it? Is it completed? Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help. Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey. ... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac. No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight- I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in? Of course. And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri. Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario! I don't know. You don't remember anything else? No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here. Not at all. How 'bout another cup of coffee? I've got patients coming in -- And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee? Get him out of here! Here, Lester. This hyperdrive had better work. I've never seen it fail. Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name? It ain't Geronimo. Who are you? I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation. Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world. Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right? I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum. This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home. Jack, he's starting a conversation... He was trying to kill you, right! Yes. Not the other way around...? No. Is it something you've done? It's something I do... You're out of your mind. So you're gonna bitch up? What's that supposed to be, psychology? I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you. Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on. -- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what? Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want. Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see. Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall? He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead -- It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this. Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- It's easy for you to be patient. No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben. Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. Take it yourself. Take a date. I don't have a date. I don't want a date. Why? Vincent Bastaldi is in jail. I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but... All right! Then call! At least, call! Will anyone else say they knew? I don't know. I don't think so. How did you get into the store? I took Doris's keys. Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back? ...I don't think so. Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all? Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits? Right now? Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out. Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all? Yes ma'am. Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy. Mustard's good on 'em to me. Okay. A satellite dish? Well I was just throwing out ideas... Maybe they're right. Which `they' might that be, sir? Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs. Program name? Resurrection. What do you mean? After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time. What's that supposed to mean? What do you think? Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months-- No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel! In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability -- What are you talking about?  My "condition"?... No, they're not from Wendy. Your Secret admirer? Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven. In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin? Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things? The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that? Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now. And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that -- Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet? I poisoned him. Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you? You fixed my suit? You don't trust me? But I don't know how -- You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman... All in, boss! Move it out. Movin' it out, boss. Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad? Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...? And what are you going to do?! I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here. But how are you going to escape? Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal. But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us! I can't! Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>? I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker. Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night? I was at home. Were <i>you</i> alone? Yes. So we don't know for sure about you, either. No. Why don't we say we were together? Why would we do that? I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you? Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now... What are you trying to say to me, Fish? Yeah. No thanks. Please. Why not? Because it was a lie. You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down. You can't blame me for trying. Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes. We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street. As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally But we've got to verify it legally To see... To see? If she... If she? Is morally, ethic'ly Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to? How I make my living, what's your point? This. Raise the sails. The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them. We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines. <u>WHY</u>? He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance. What makes you think he'll do it? He seems like he thrives on danger No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz... They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not? Did she actually say she'd go out with you? That's what I just said Oh no...I think there's carrots in here... Send it back if you don't want it. What is it now? I'm losing my blood! You're losing your blood? Yes! Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ... It's Robert. Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still... Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea. Jackson? Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off. Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform. Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart. He flies as well, then . . . Constantly. He has powers as we do . . . Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice. We will bring him to his knees! Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny. Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me. Hello? I know who he is. Maya?  What do you mean? I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight? Did you tell her about us, Harry? There is no us, you psychotic bitch. Sure.  Say that now. Here, right around Centaurus A. This is how you see the sky? It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight. It's beautiful. Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too. ... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here? ... Electrical connection malfunctioning. You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean? That we swim. Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying. Michael, the sub's dead. Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle. Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you. Hey, Findley's here. Where? Over there by the bar. You make me weak. Not as weak as I. Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown. Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty? Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'. Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity? That's Marvin Acme, the gag king. Shoulda guessed. He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit. Big on the musical comedy, huh? Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie. On whose authority, Corporal ? This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission. What will this prove? You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to. So? So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. And what happens when you lose? If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present. Was nice. Yes. Sara? Hi. It's Grady. Where are you, Grady? An elevator? I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about... You're in Kinship? Yes. But that's not why I called... With Emily? What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just... Just what? Doing a little dusting? Hey, Miles. Long time no see. Gary. When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it. Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week. My condolences. What are you pouring tonight? Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste? Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding. Yes. Death and Taxes"? How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work? Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay. Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol? If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here? The body cannot live without the mind. I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert. Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there? Right in front of the room. Fine. Is this because of the radiation? What? Nothing. We'll have to let them go. Surveilliance on them all. Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did. But she's such a nice lady. But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise? You're two hours late. I know.  It's her fault. Who told them that? I have no idea. Why not? I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself. What is it? Is it all right if I go to the bathroom? You want a martini? No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he? It's really a tremendous turnoff. You should see the one we wear when it rains. Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni. The what? You know, the big machine that cleans the ice. Oh yeah. It's quite an honor. Will you come with me? Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account. Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady? I beg your pardon? Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool. I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert. It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny. Damn. Your dad did this? We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen. So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me. You practically bribed him with your erector set. No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose. That's not going to stop his nightmare - I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>. Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there? Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now -- Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things... Twelve. What, honey? I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect -- I know you do, darling. And you could care less -- Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it. Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play? Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath? I think they'll be all right, honey. I made you some cocoa.  See? Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams. Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves? Illusions, Madam? You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit? These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see. Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this. Mr. Warne? Yeah. Come in. Sit down. ... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint... Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open. I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love. Yes. That could be true. ... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until... You bet your ass he will. Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility. Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA. I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader. You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock. I can't stop thinking about you. Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill. What old mill? Is that somewhere we -- I just wanted to say that. Come by my house. Hi, Peter. Hi. How'd you find this place? Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child. You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested. Hey -- it's all for the higher good right? Rats! I've lost number three. What happened, Ted? What went wrong? Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan. It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell. I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it. We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol -- But you passed the test! Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless. What?!  Did you know that!? Your father? No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him. It sounds like it's trying to get in. I'm going to see what it is. Ah!  You're ambulatory! What a brilliant diagnosis! But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours. And what about you? If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them. Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right? That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember? Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore. Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you? Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la. Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time! Yeah, well... I still have your underwear. I still have your virginity! Oh my God, SHUT UP! What? Are you ashamed that we did it? No... Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet! The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them -- Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom. I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie. I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he? Are his folks nice? You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning. How did it happen? It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes? I saw Karen Sisco. Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow? Hildy! Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life. It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years. What've you got there? Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you. Show me. I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited... That little prick. Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father. That little prick. I paid for it and everything. There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this. Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy. Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick! <U>Why</U>...?! The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet. <U>Why</U>?! The Creator has not answered. The carbon-units are not responsible for that. You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner. Hanover!! Hanover!! Forget them... We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan? Um hm.  That's right, Maya. So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan... Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted. Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn. Aaron, how you doin'? Fine. Look at me. What? Why you have an attitude for? Not now, I'm busy God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you. Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck. This guy must have been a real pain in your dick. Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice? Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant .. Whass going on here? Reilly, Vice. I- Quiet! Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it. No! I want to talk about it now! Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean? Why not?! Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born! Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden? Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us! So... we understand each other Judge? Yeah. Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful. Wladek, please. You like gymnastics? I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though. We're not always as good at things as we'd like. Yeah, but I was really not good. Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there. This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much. Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street.. Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest. Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'. Sir?  What did he say? Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell. What do you mean, she was a hot number. If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do? Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself - But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance! Helen.  I appeal to you - Larry! I hear you. All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour. EXT. DAM - DAY. It's Marty on the Coast - On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>... Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess. You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him? What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay. That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain. Is that all? Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell. I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there? Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow. Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast. Blue, then. Blue is cold. Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... Tomorrow is the full moon. That's good, Alex.  Reassure me. Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right? Right. I called you all weekend.  Where were you? I went out on the boat. It made me realize something. I'm an idiot. Really? Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better. Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along? Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now. Yeah,  Right. Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils? OWCH! That's really got to hurt. Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth. What are you talking about? Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison. A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?! Did I get you up? No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face. Somebody's poisoned the water hole... It's busted. When does this thing stop? It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop. It's true. Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories. What are they? To calm your anxiety. To calm my anxiety. I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans? Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah. Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that? ...You know! For kids! ...Why don't I just type this up... Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess. Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man. Well, she probably had a deadline... Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record! Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam... I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious. I agree. Let's have a look, do you mind? Of course. I would like to look. About damn time. What the hell is it? Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s. That's would be me. Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay? It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right? Yeah. You're with me now. Yeah. Right? Uh-huh. You sure? Yeah. Yeah. No! I had no idea until after, but -- You're loving me now, aren't ya? I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money. Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking! But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest! -- good afternoon -- -- you've got to leave. Brady! Get up there Rachel! Brady! Come with us! Brady! Go! Step number two. Okay. Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine. What calls? Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time. I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother. You know what, I'm just gonna crash. Fine...Maybe I'll come by later. Nah.  I have curfew. Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo. This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet! Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now. Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal. Why not? I need to get in there! I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route. That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich. I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel. Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end. Where are you going? ..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner... I don't like that story. But king Arthur was always your favorite. Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me? You got no idea... Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT. Quite a circus. And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer? Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it. Stop kidding. Wait a minute. Tell them to come on in. But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to. It doesn't matter who they are. And one of 'em is sick. Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up. See...?  Were you the guy who broke in? Was I? Yes. No. Then don't sweat it, George, you know why? No. You have nothing to hide. When I talk to the police, I get nervous. Yeah.  You know who doesn't? No, who? Thieves. Why? They're inured to it. You think so? Yes. It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead.. Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves. I'll go up and take a look at the General  - perhaps sit with him. He won't even know you're there. He is delirious. All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately. Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here. Well    Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him. Thank you, I'll do that. Good night. Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot. Brave, Sir Rob ... Shut up. I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week. It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. Well. Old age flattens a man. Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway. Uh-huh. ...Blake Blake? The poet...something he said... Yes? Tortuga? Oh -- did I forget to mention that? Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh? How perfect. He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her. Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't? What that? Barefaced. He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right? You can't to that... Wrong. Where's Sid? Damned if I know. She ditched me. You weren't supposed to leave her alone. I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together. It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear. You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it? Thanks, Pollux. For what? For being one helluva guy. Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up. I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh? Yes, Dad. Good. OPEN THE DAMN SAFE! All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk... Why? Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here. Have you thought about graduate school? No. Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work? You got me. Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass. Whatta you so happy about? I just always did like truck rides. Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant. No, that's quite all right. It's terrific Win. You still writing the occasional magazine article? Occasionally. Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek. Hi. Hi.  How are you doing? Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation? The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department. My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling... What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say? I don't-. You do know. Try. Thank you. You're a nice man. Roger? Rockin'! Scotty? I don't believe it. Hello. Darren, we better turn around. Why? Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly. What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs -- Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look. Well, I'll try to give her one. I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother? Just for the first year. That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow! This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world. No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like? Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something. Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you. Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it -- I'm asking you again, who made you do this? I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this. What the fuck is going on? Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail? No! Heard there was some excitement. Just a couple of kooks... Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable. Like me. No. Not like you. How so? Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute. Well, that was money well spent. Let's go. You know what they say about men who need big guns... Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet. Down boy. Who you callin' "boy? Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh? Yeah.  Got my own sign. So ... ? We outgrew each other. Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two. You don't pick your brother. Yeah. So how's the cat food business? Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week. Your breakfast, monsieur. I don't feel like any breakfast. No!  You're playing with my mind! I'm trying to play with your body! I knew it--you're seducing me! Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty? I think you're real cute. Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious! You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave. How you doing, Artie? I... You know... I... I... I don't really know. Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help? No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school. Well, I hope it stays that way. It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true. Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks? That's right! At the expense of six people. They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles? Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got? A derelict. I put up new drapes, Jake. I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember? You never said anything.  About the drapes. They look nice. You haven't even looked at them once. He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic. And you can?  Power it up? I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around. I'll be around. This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well? Well... sure... Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room. But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative... That's terrible news... There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me. I'm not sewing anything else. You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk. No! Hana, I know you do! How old are you, Captain? I'll be twenty next year, sir. I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath. Delighted, sir. You don't think this is just infatuation, do you? Oh no.  Do you? No. Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello? Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled. Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation? Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl. Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been. Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you. Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift. I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner? Not as a condition -- a request. How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two? Okay. How you doin'? I'm doing fine. You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay. Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go! Louise is alright. I thought you said the eggs weren't... It's fine. Mind your own meal... You should get the order you want. And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty. You know where she gets this from! You shut up. No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face. Getting anywhere with those? There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute. Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria? Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish. You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die. Did I? You don't remember that? I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic. Any word from that gallery? Not yet. Nervous? ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries. You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave? So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF? I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa? Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode. How about a little Parmesan cheese on that? Okay, Sam.  Thanks. You remember your price, Stamp? Never found out. I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder. No use thinking these things now. Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free? Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing. They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth.. I don't believe that. I won't. There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub. Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major! INT. TUNNEL - DAY. You have to believe to have faith. You don't believe in anything? The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles. Interpreted by another guy like my father. Your father doesn't like me. Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice -- Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening? This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up. Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim? Somebody named Leo Crow. And who the hell is that? I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours. All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this... I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive! Then come to my house.  We'll talk -- I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me. How could Witwer have accessed the case file? Can you fake the cerebral output? We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out. You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room -- John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow? What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates? Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then. Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer? Right here Frank. You want me to pour it? No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer. There ya go. Good, let's drink up. They? Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick. What else could I do? Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh? Lois, someday -- Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me. I like worrying about you. Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that. Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship. Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even... You have ten seconds. All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up. One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus? Hell, peanut... One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen. How'd you find this place? Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child. Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped... I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case. Do something, Jonathan! Kill it! You have got to be joking? All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged. Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other. It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here. I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing? I don't know you. Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor. I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl - What did you say? I'm a very sick girl. Maybe I'd better go before I catch something. I'm not that sick. I have a very low resistance. Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey. You got some? I know where to get some.  Don't move. All right.  Let's get out of here. The soldiers are going to kill those people! Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh? Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did. Aw, Long John . . . I tell you it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this. Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?! Just wait! You equipped for random questions? Why, yes, of course. You start. The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me? How do I stop one? Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run, Okay, but... I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement. Yah, Shep Proudfoot said - Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man? Shep said 8:30. We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already. I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess. Ya got the car? Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera. Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud. Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then? Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be? Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas. Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state? 1959. Who use to own it? Russia. When did we get it from them? 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course. What's the capitol? Juneau. Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha! Sorry, that's the largest city. Objection! I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater? Really nice wheels, by the way. Wait-- listen-- What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit? Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink. A bus? Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus! Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place. Oh my God...we re buried alive... We re alright. -- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize... I'm sorry... I don't know what to say. I think goodbye is traditional. The old man and woman called me... Phillippe. Phillippe.  Rest now. MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class. I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi. Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy. Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera. So can I come along? No. This ain't gonna work. Rae... I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work. Rae don't do this now... It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid! Rae! I don't like this. I don't like it one bit. Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus? You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now! What does it say? John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that-- --jeeeeeeesus-- --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats-- --jeeeeeeesus-- --according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971-- --jeeeeeeesus-- --almost a year before he left the Justice Department-- --jeeeeeeeeesus-- --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund-- --all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard. Sir, I'd like to ask you a few-- --what time is it? 11:30. Morning or night? Night. Oh. I m having kind of a bad day. I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays... Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please? Oh, yeah.  Sure. No!  You gave your word! Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where. You have an unusual hand. I could have told you that. You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split. You wanted to see me, Mr. M.? Just wait outside. Tammy. Okay.  But is this about the posters? Possibly.  Please just wait outside. Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside. That your gate down there? Yes. I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye. I guess so.  Thank you, Carter. You take care of yourself, Lee. Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev... Get in the goddamn room. There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING. You're lying...! I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me. Starck... Cooper... Oh God! What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote? Goddamn you! I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up. Stay away from me! I'm not going to hurt you. Stay away from me! What, What, I can't hear you... Are you <u>alright</u>...? I almost shot the <u>baby</u>... Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...? This is it. Where's Ricky. I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with. That's not true, honey-- It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine. Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?! That soulless monster gets no tears from me. Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster. Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately! Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it. Now tell me something I don't know. All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island. So we should set out a smorgasbord? You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me... No... LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed. Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!? ...cause you said... HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'! Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord. HARRY! Here he comes. Tom? You can come on. They gone. We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John? Yeah, it'll satisfy me. Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy? I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame! A vote is before the group. Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts. Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand. Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack. See you. You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee-- Never better. Yeah. Drowned, too. My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit. Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while. She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man? What do you mean, it changes? CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent? Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys. As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true. And why do you tell us this only now? I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it... Ready to rock? Ready. You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too. Can't do that now, though, can you? Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V... Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot. Huh huh. This says Beavis. And Boot-Head. That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us. Yeah, we should party. Where are you going? We'll meet you at the inn. Can't I come, too? No. Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin. It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young. Reverend Mother? Yes? Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows? Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in. I don't have any idea. Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere. Hey... Sheila. What's the BITCH'S name?! Look Sheila... I'm sorry... YOU'RE SORRY!! Go home, Sheila. So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions. I told you -- Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours. No. You said you weren't with him for love. I wasn't. What then? I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it. He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he? Oh, baby, what's going on? I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me. Oh, Tangerine. Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense. Good for you. Your turn... Your mother was a saint. --but Buddy Deeds was my salvation. Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think -- All your other fluzzies? Yeah. Yes. You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now. Are you gonna tell her what you've done? Yes. Will you say my name? If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done. Well can you do me one favor and don't do that. I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing... This guy.  Where was he? She was in here when it went down. Can she I.D. them? They were wearing masks. Of course they were. How many? Three. It could just as easily have been me in that box. I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo. What about bowling? Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero. You're a scumbag. You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help. That's alright.  We'll take it from here. Hi.  I was worried I was early. I was a lot earlier. Hey, George.  You okay? Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good. Do you have a boyfriend? No, not really. Interesting. Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun. Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life? Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing. Growing. I'm glad you said that. Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-... ...-fall. Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but-- But... ...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major... ...screwup? Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at... ...noon. Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian... ...scientists. You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet. Where's their protective... ...gear? It's a hundred degrees... ...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break? They'll get a break tomorrow. What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money! Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I? I want to know why . Are you having me on? Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane. ...they say you're alright. I'm fine. This is it, then. What? The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you? He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault. That's not what I hear. I was flying...my responsibility. That's what you get flight pay for. Maybe I shouldn't take it. Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen. Not to me. You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part. The Stealth Eagle is about to fly. Ditto for the Swooping Swallow. We make love? No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work. Not any more. Why are they under there? Mom doesn't like me to have them. It's been fired. In the battle, sir. It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito. Well, Ahm.... Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop. He's nice. Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead! You d better get going. My parents will be  round to cart you off to the country. Whatever you do, don t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf. Your probably best off pretending you re asleep. What do you think it is? I think it's a gun pressing against my dick. You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga. No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other. Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E? A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got. Yes, monsieur. Right away... instantly! Yes. What is it? You want -- Not you. I want Ricky to answer. Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them. We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life... Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down. But not you. There are days. You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard. In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me... ... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so. You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't. Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son. Oh, I have to hear this. In my heart, Heather's still alive. What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at? I'm sayin' we har this man away. Assa good idea, Pappy. This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one -- How am I going to explain this to Walter? She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy-- That's enough, Ellen. I'm sorry that I'm not taking you. So am I, Frank. He's a very shy boy... What? Something Lecktor said. Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh... It's not over yet. It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight. You gonna talk to the people who did those murders? That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed. ...Too bad. That was good. Yeah, right. That's all you meant? What else? That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger. Who? Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them. Hi... Hi. Don't worry, we'll find her. Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her. I told you... She won't let you leave... Son of a bitch! He agreed that he was. What do you think his name is? I've no thoughts on the subject. Whoo-hoo! Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?! Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY? Roger, I've got it. I'm hurting. You on a roll? Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me? Sorry. Why does it have to feel so bad? You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer. Hey Butt-Head it's that chick! Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score. It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy. It was Krueger, wasn't it? We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans. We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds? You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders? Yeah. I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him? That's Deleon and Hayes' collar. They around? Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad. Where's the collar, in the cells? No, I think he's up in interrogation. I'll go find Hayes. It's funny, all right. Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear. These boys aren't playing around. You've got to stop them.  Please! You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about. There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly. You're insane. I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly. And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend. Hold it. What's that man's name? Why do you want to know? He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$. Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself. A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip? No thanks -- keeping my head clear. There's a vent shaft leading straight up. Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top. If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me. Who's is all this? It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake? I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass. How? By taking my money? You can keep what you won today. That's yours. It's all mine. Sit down, Leo. You want to see me, Senator? Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened? The ranger's notices? No idea at all. No? No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job. By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where? Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address. Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit-- That's right. Oh, now--that won't do-- Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse-- You're the best nurse I can think of-- Nice *compliment*! I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment-- No? You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble-- And I'm an old hand at following instructions-- You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see-- Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years-- You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington. Yeah?  And what else? What do you mean? Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks-- I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides-- I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time. I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable. ...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales. Finish, please! This is going to give you nightmares. I like this story. You get it yet? Naw, nothing. You will.  You'll get it. I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open. You really think there's a treasure inside? I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing. Who did you hear it from? I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri? You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport. Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him. No, I came here to drink... myself... you know... To death? Yes, that's right. Y'know, I'm sort of psychic. Yeah? Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff? I don't know. Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know? Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know. Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right? Yeah, I guess. But I think I am. I like to think I am. It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you? Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say. Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have. I think about that. Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ? It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home. So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me. Oh no, no... Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor. I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you... So what firm you with, pal? Jackson, Steinem... ...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal. ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff. ...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know? Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko. So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here? Johnny, it's the only way. Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions. I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is. It's on the table, Dad. How long has it been, Uncle Alfred? Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter. The security's actually not that severe. It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails. So what did he say? Good job.  And thanks. Continental Casualty... Mr. Alito, please. Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch... I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number? I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed... ...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him... I can't guarantee that... I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent. Why can't I stay with you? It's not possible right now. Why? Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now .. How the hell did you do that? Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening. Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying? They're...pretending to dress. What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes? Is this your place ? Do you care ? No, not much. Let's keep it that way, shall we? No personal details? That's right. No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey. I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay? I'm in the bridge. Barnes? I liked being with you last night. . same here. Actually, I'm waiting for someone. What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too. Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder. Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors. Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans? That's Lednov!  We come along here. And meet him there. Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up. I wouldn't do that!!! It's a bomb. Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going. Lester - he called you here. Right. Here. He was just on the phone. He called you right here. I just talked to him. So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now. Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I - That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's - He's sittin' by the phone - What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house! Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go! It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know. Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now? You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now? Go! Go! Get in the car! Go! Go! Go! Go! What a strange fellow. Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though. Why does he call you 'master'? She'll have to know some time. Not from me. Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals. I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together. When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle. A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni! I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time. You said don't say nothing and I didn't. No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead. You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing. All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't. How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him? He already knew it. Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now. Whatta you doing out there? I'm going into the movie business. What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star? I'm thinking about producing. How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies. I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer. Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit. What colour is your car?  What colour is your car? B-Black... Where is it? Downstairs... At the front... Jesus... NAZIS!! What's the matter, Wendy? Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand. God damn it, why does she keep saying that? You want my heart? It is my only object. To make me wretched in two weeks. To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands. The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me. Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent. But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer. It's you. The resemblance is... striking. We're better off by ourselves. But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that. I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again. Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will. And give you a good buzz. Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity. Uh. No it won't? Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter. They don't know what's going on! You're in Oklahoma?! Not yet. Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to. Can't it go to any office? No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code. When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask? Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you. After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive? He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs. How do you know all this? I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit. Don't! Shut up! About our secrets. No. Why, pray tell? Because John said I mustn't. You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job. But I said I was sorry.... No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem? Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I... Okay - you got your one. You follow my car. How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind... ...how so? ...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>... And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>... No, this is <u>pleasure</u>... And what was the trip <u>before</u>...? That, that was <u>business</u>... Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away. I have. Or there would be twice as many. But you're the fairest by far. You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why? You really look awful. Not half as bad as I feel. Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed. Wyatt Earp is my friend. Hell, I got lot's of friends. I don't. Uh huh, pleasure. Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak. Let go -- he can't -- ! Only half of you would get there. Good one. Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual. Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie, Who? You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died. Fascist! If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed. You smell gas? Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here. Jesus. Hey, it's the best way to tell. You get it straightened out? I think so, Beth.  Yes. Why did you people come here? Air... water... your "sun. Where do your people come from?  Where is your home? Here... now. And before here? Many worlds... Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us? Peace? No peace. What do you want us to do? Die. Oh look what he did in them. Drop it. Son of a bitch! Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here? It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure... Are you all right? Adds flavor.... Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be... Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk... Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home. Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards... Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'. Okay... Did you have a pleasant trip? Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad. ... That's what you told us to say. Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem? What? I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut. I had to tell 'em something. Never say anything unless you have to. I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me! Nick, I love you -- JESUS CHRIST! Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca. This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca. That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France. Occupied France? Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me. What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past. There are only two other alternatives for him. What are they? It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here. And the other alternative? My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle. Yes? Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall. Have you tried the recall again? Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all. What's the target. Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa. Just in time, too. In time for what? What? Just in time for what? No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own. I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing. Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!! Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life. A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture. Is that what this is about? Material wealth? What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance. The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me. Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind? How did you have a baby? It came out of me. Did you know what was going to come out? Yes. Did you want it to come out? No. Why? Because I was afraid. Why were you afraid? Because I wasn't worthy. To be a mother? Yes. Why? May I open my eyes now? No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you? It grew. What made it grow?  Do you know? Yes. Would you like to tell me? No. Did anyone else know about the baby? I can't tell you that. Will she be angry? She made me promise not to. Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick. I'm afraid. Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed. I ate. Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner? Fish...  ... brussel sprouts. You don't like brussel sprouts? I hate them. Is it true? Is ignorance bliss? Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD. Thanks for covering for me. No problem, but who's Susan? My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette. I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan? She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her. I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her. Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist? I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on? Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon. This is not a dream! This is my life. Of course it is. What else could it be? Why? Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married. Sweet breezes...Sweet women.... You have something to say about everything.... Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you. Sure. ...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere. You know where it is? What? I know where it is. You want to ask me a question? See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.   One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him? Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters. Yeah, I heard of it. That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else. Did Dickie's Dad go? He's having an early night. Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap. ...I'm sorry....? ...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>... Indeed we were. ...and my need for The Institution... Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon. And how did he do that? He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it... I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy... ...you have to <u>eat</u>... What do I do now? Take a deep breath and hold it. That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute. Just put your mask on. As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight. No? Should we close down any eruption? Are you sure? We're seeing all the signs in town. I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing? I know. Tracy. Ethics are... Come on! He's dead. -- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here. Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon. Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue... No, I want to have this marked, Mr. - ...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application. Denying? Do I hear a motion seconded? Mr. Chairman - I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there? But this time they'll be ready. We'll see about that. Don't you think there's too much gold? It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on... I don't know, I think... Look, would you argue with your doctor? No. I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there? But this time they'll be ready. We'll see about that. Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams. How do you do. My brother, Tom Hagen. Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders? May I talk to you alone? Deploy the collector. He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming? He's floating.  Take it home. Hector. Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious. Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer? Can I see him? Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him. Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you. The Scimitar will serve my needs. But surely... I came this far alone ... I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me. Fuckers! He does. Could we have a table close to him? And as far away from Major Strasser as possible. People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go. Really. Truly. I saw it in The Eye. The Old Lady by the swamp. She was a witch. No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic. I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens. So how does it happen? Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you. You're nothing but a... a... The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long. Well? Well divide 18 into three Six six and six Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here. How do you know? Our network covers the Ranger games. Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you. Why George, are you proposing? Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but... George---I thought you'd never ask. Hey.  I got another question for you. What's that? You know him? No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words. I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find. Why are you here, Mr. Wladek? It's like this... I...we...all of them. Anything new develop? Unfortunately, no. Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here. Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders... Don't worry, we've got everything. Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island... I know, I know. One thing at a time. What are you going to do? Go down there and kill everybody, I guess. I don't gamble. Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid. It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble. You know I am. Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there... Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes... Keep Talking.... What guards Us Against Canada...? Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort. There is no such regulation. Tell me I'm dreamin'. I just gotta talk to her, T.J. No questions. You may call your next witness. Are you dining on worms? You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died. The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us. Tell me about your garden. Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling. Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady. What's your being married got to do with it? It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd? What C-4...was Cox talking about? Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night. Where did you plant the C-4?! ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam... What? Palace? Hardly. Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City... A shame.  You looked great tonight. Please. You did! When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either. Why was he missing for twenty days? Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear... Uh, hello? WB2YKXB, who've I got? Name's John. Who wrote it? But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even. You don't know, do you? And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow. The park? Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up. Who wrote it? Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl. Fuck me. Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody. She's a programmer? Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her. I've got a girlfriend, remember? Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost. What about the phosphorous grenade? One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this -- Morning. Good morning Mrs. MacNeil. How are you today? Fine thank you. That's good. Weir. He's dead... It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine. Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life. I see: He'd walk out next month. That's right. We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking? I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial. You're pissing me off again, Ed. You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu. Well, well. In a real hurry, are we? Always, for you, baby. Hey, George.  You okay? Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good. Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I? That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy. Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too? You bet.  Did you like it? Julia. Oh my God. Don't look at me. Who are you? I said: don't look. Yeah. Could you see anything? Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still. What did you do? Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture? Yeah. What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit? Wanna fuck? Sure. The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know. That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus? Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company? You know Laurel Canyon? I'll find it. I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel. Gimme an hour. William Taupin seems to have left his mark. Yes. And you are William Taupin, aren't you? Yes. You're in the stomach! Let me try. One more time! Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other. The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane. I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique? Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses. Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man. Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody. That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression. Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance. What? What's this? I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them. Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up! Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise. I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him? I met him in New York. Marge! You've got to hear this! This is a vicious cycle. I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do. Isn't this technically a scooter? When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had. Kinda tough on the butt. Everything has it's drawbacks. Where did your brother escape from? The mental hospital. What does he do? He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while... Whoa. It's a vicious cycle. Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me. -- C'mon, Stephen. -- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before. I'm sorry... Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you? These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done. Run to the nearest phone and call the police. Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know... Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital. A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him. Only in mutual advantages -- moreover... What are you doing here? I told her to come. Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there. Thanks...partner. No, Captain, please. No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient. If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do? I try not to expect you. But if it got late and I hadn't shown up? Then I'd think there must be a reason. You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban. You and your real estate. Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this? It isn't a Park Avenue address. really. So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address. Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids. Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything. Okay, cool. I'll try to drop by later. I wasn't too over the top? No, it was the perfect level. Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good. Ready? Yeah... You scared me. I didn't aim to. Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'? No ma'am. Okay - you got your one. You follow my car. Are those just button buttons or...? Of course not. Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor. With pleasure, Madame! Get out of here. Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green? Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go! No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart! Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth! Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas. Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man? You. Yeah, well I kinda figured that. You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck. Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios. Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free. No, we... Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address. All she needed for that was the phone book! No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer. When I find out who that phony bitch was. Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude. I'm having a stroke. You've come far. You're a good man. I love you. What? That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me. That can't feel good. No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist. I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times. Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there. Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich. How do you do, Mr. Rick? We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting? We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read? There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product... And what is that? What are they doing? They appear to be modifying the deflector dish. I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv. Yeah, where's your machine gun. Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what? He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either... Don't tell me about this... We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else? Mr. Leland sent back that check. What check? You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago. Oh, yes, the bonus. It was for twenty-five thousand dollars. It ain't even three years we been married. Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good. Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid? Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet. They... they shot me. They shot us all, kid. What day is it? Same day as before.  I think. I don't believe him. Why? He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it. Are you going to see James tonight? Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time. You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you? Maybe. Oh god, Laura. Well, why not? Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love". Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off? Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him. Equipment? Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers... He's making a fine recovery. He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time. I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right. Did we do it? Did we make a difference? Yes.  Thank you. Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise. So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen? No, he picked me up. Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images... Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why? What do you mean by that? Just what you think I mean. Are you threatening me? Sort of... Yeah. Yes. Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run! Did you say...? Uh, uh... Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it. One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play. You're not losing trust, are you? Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it. Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it. Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers? Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow? Hildy! Out? Where are you going? I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all. No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us. That's right! Anyone skim the pool? It needs it. Harry -  I'm going. Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen.. Listen to what? I need your help and I thin you can use mine. Your help?  What are you talking about? Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away. Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy. The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star. What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy. You could be swinging on a star. Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is... BASTARDS! Come back here and face me! Get buckets! You bastard -- Poor baby. Bastard. Hush now. It's all right Frank's here. Frank -- That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK. No, I want to walk. Come here. Come on, now. I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor. Collected shoes too? I'm scared I'm slipping back. We're going to do this. You have to say that. That's true. So what're we gonna do? ...What do you mean? Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but... But what? I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin! That's why I hate experts. Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it! Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent. -- Eddie... You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look -- I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them... Sure... And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could... What? What could he do? How are you holding up? I'm swell. And all we've got is a witch doctor! Yeah. I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not. I want to talk to you, Pierce. There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something. I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten. What are you doing here? I see... I am sorry, Duncan... He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand. He'll be dead when he does. I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you? Just ... uh ... you know. Of course. A what? An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you. Give me this fucking thing. What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back! I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave. Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now. For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left. What do you care? When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot. Give me my book. You gonna put it away? I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it. Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it. Barefaced. He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right? Will you have a cigar? No, thank you. Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES. For real? Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain! I can fairly hear my heart beating! Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning. Yeah. I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!! You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left. You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child. I had him in my grasp. Cheer up.  You may still. Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office. Life is waiting. I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main. What else? What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else. That where he was shot? That's where he fell. You get much of that in here? It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out-- Deal drugs in the bathroom-- If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands. When do I get to see Brad? After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage? What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left! You've got the public upset, Al. But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it. When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen. What are ya tellin' me, Charlie? Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar? No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy. What is this? About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables. No, Carter.  I can't take this. It's okay, I got lots more. What are you doing here? Fixing a leak under your sink. What do you think our chances are? If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise. How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter? It wasn't easy. It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl! We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there. You want to share it? Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck. Right. How about a lift, mister? Can't you see that sticker? General Jack D. Ripper, sir. I want to talk to General Ripper. But we can't communicate with the base. God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself. I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone. You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet. Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. Who are we talking about? But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her. Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it? Susan's patient is whom we are talking about. One of mom's cups got broken. I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece. I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you. Arlyn Page. Did she and Jane McKenna know each other? Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time. Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too. Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her. You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars. I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds? Don't worry. You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed. Skillful?  I missed my first shot. Some miss all their shots. Somebody could have gotten hurt. That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else. You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton. Philip. Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life. That's because I am the shark. We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself. The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos... How about some ginger pie? Eh, fine. I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse? Oh, it's fine. Fine. She seemed yare to me. Yeah, got to do something about you. You putting a hurtin' on my vision. Rick...? I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch. I've been meaning to come in a long time. You live in the neighborhood? Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by. How old is he? Four.  You're great with these kids. Probably he means no harm. He's really very short on charm. Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme. Yes, some of the time. I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate? One of your suitors? One of my suitors. My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted Tell me about your adopted MOTHER Well, you can... Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d. All my model planes. The ones you built? They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up. I have to go to the bathroom. Yeah. If there's anything I can do, sir... God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at... But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir? All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand... Yes, sir... What's so important in Los Angeles? Your father has business. Why today? And why'd she have to go with him? The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence... The Judgment is ours! Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography. It's a whozis. It's a whozis? If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying. Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell. Okay, I know what I want this time. Anything you need. Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up. That's it? Just tell him to come over here and talk to me. And I can go free? Go, fo' I change my mind. When did you get back? Just now. My God. I haven't seen you since... Dante. You've got a customer. You're Starkiller? Yes, sir. Have you been checked out? Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2. Shall we go to my office? Thank you. In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove. The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released! To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices. Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension. Who is it? It's Marika.  Is Paula there? She's at work.  I'm her mother. Oh.  I thought today was Saturday. Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count. What about his killer? Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence. What's with the eyelids? Thanks. Have a good one. Do you mind if I drink this here? Sure. Go ahead. I guess I left it in my room. What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money. What is it now? Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died. I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have? Sea bass. Right. They're mutated sea bass. Really? Are they ill-tempered? Please allow me to demonstrate. Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table.... Good news travels fast.... A tremor! Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable. What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her. There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs. Why do you want to do that for? Would make me feel better about it. You sure about that? I'm sure. Okay. You're a good man, Fergus. Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing... With a Ramses graph on the binary tree-- --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side-- Maker can. This is not new, Gerry! Who the hell made up that law?! You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch. What is happening around here!!! There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods! Where's Taylor? He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing? Go in, get after her! I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15. Do we have to talk wedding details? Oh, no, of course not. Shall we unpack it? Yes. Put my car in the garage and close the door. John, I don't understand any of this. You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy. John, why?... Just do it! You what? Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing. For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there. Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst! I'm horny, Jack, what about you? ...yeah..... Does Jack like to Jack Off? Sometimes when I'm lonely. ...yeah....well you have me now. You sound very cute, very nice. Thank you. What do you do, Barry? I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business. Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money? I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start. So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey? No. Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me? Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry. So tell me.  Where's Z? I...I have no idea, sir. Okay, son. I mean...where is everbody? Poolside? Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way. You'd like me to kill them? I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity. Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean? Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him. Why were you given notice? They're not obliged to tell. It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day. Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard. You don't believe that. I wouldn't put it past him. That's too bad. What? Nothing.  Is that the kitchen? Look, Ma, no wires. You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour. How the fuck do you do that? Now I'm going to have to kill you. I don't think so.  You need me alive. Why?  So you can fuck my wife? It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after. And if I say yes? Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe. Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us. What do you call this? A car. Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain. From over the mountain -- Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon! I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags -- Mop rags --! The 405 is coming up. Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up? What the fuck is he doing? Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message. It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated. All of them? You know this guy, don't you? I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out. By stealing my car? I would've come back for you. Yeah. Yeah. ... Your civil rights have been overridden! Open it, Captain! Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat! She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's. You get down here! Just wait there for me! Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker! How you doin' Mister D? Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case? Where did you go before? When? Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor. You must have been dreaming. Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering -- Sure, Doc. How come you're alone on New Year's Eve? Well, I have things to do -- What's this -- you packing? Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment. Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception. Are the cars ready? They've been ready for the last half hour. Hi.  Donna Irving? Yes? I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe? You're a lawyer? Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute? People show their happiness in a lot of different ways. Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral. My God. What? You've taken some strange journeys in your life. Yeah.  You could say that. You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that. Not much. You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it. What, um...  What do we do? There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time. Why do you keep saying that? Do you know what a Vampire-King is? A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula? Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos. Oh, him. Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention. What? We'll cover it later. I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies? In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them. Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this? We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents. ... It could have gotten to somebody... Anybody sick? No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease... What's wrong? Your eye. What about it? There's something black in the green part of your eye. Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris... ...A flaw... ...Yes, sort of a birthmark... I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you. Are we? Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend... Thank you.  I'm Rob. Duh. You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick. Perhaps. But if you go back they'll lock you up again. No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy. I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment. I blame myself. I'm going to find your sister. I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag. But I'm not joking. Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson. But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - - You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson. But I understand her. That may be more important. It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense. Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work... What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba. I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out. It's not even a mile. We should have driven. Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back. You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine? Whoa. Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it. Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life. Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff. So you're going to stop acting? No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along. Uh-huh. We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down. If that's what feels right. It does. Feels right. Then it's a good thing. Yeah. It's good. Feels good. You have no right... And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do. She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life. And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live. I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion. No, I think it's just the beginning. See? We're not so bad. Not so bad. Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called. I know Daddy. I'm worried about him. Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . . Daddy . . . ? Yes, darling? Stuff it. Are you stupid or what? What? Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit! Yes. It has. ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you? Yes. I will. Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello. Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you. Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home. God, how I have looked forward to this, honey. Hooker! How ya doin', Jimmy. Mph rmpmh rm. No way. Then you'll have to git ! Yeah, you'll have to git . Stop being such a bitch, Sal. I'm so sorry. It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis. Thanks for the lift, Cecil. Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke. Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know -- Whatever it is it can't be worse than this. We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair. Nice. What's the name of your label? Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha? Divide and conquer. Hullo, paw. I guess you lost some hogs to the fever. Three. Three? That ain't bad considerin'. I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish. Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now. Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience. Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm. I mean that as a compliment. I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life. Who said that? Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over. You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct? It is. Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well. He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6. But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that? It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it. Hello Nancy. Hi daddy. I know what happened. Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs. You know he's dead though, right? Initiate launch sequence. Activating injector assembly. That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself. It's awful soon after Ben's passing. If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven! John don't like him much. Pearl dotes on him. The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad. What he needs is a dose o' salts! There's something else. What? The money, Icey. I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper! I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere. You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul! I've decided not to run for President. Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France. It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous. Uh-huh. I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks. Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu. I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity. In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest. It's no big deal. You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it? I haven't been to the movies in AGES. I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work. Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame. Gloria Golden? Yeah, little Gloria. The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh? Right - for the first time this year. Well - it's only April. Come on, get going, get going! Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office. Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it. All right. Give me a voucher for expenses. What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is. I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over. And ask him about his private life. His private life? Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies? You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism! What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help! Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right? Good-night dad. Good night kiddo. We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it. The Core...! I promised Iran to Townsend. Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available. Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ... My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe... I don't believe it! I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't -- Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever. Look. No. Falling. No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble? Max, I... What is it? Winner six! How much is that? Two-hundred thousand! Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars? I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry. Todd Anderson. Paulie's gonna make him? Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him. What about Moliere? Fuck off. Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing. He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to. You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it! So how is she? Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming... I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away. Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that. Who was that? Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some? Would you mind opening the window? I always wondered what happened with us. I haven t thought about that in years. You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs? I'm not saying another word. They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner. Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres. I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business. I hear you have a new play for the Curtain. Not new--my Doctor Faustus. I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium? I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris. Good title. And yours? Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know. What is the story? Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word. Romeo is Italian. Always in and out of love. Yes, that's good. Until he meets Ethel. Do you think? The daughter of his enemy. The daughter of his enemy. His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio. Mercutio good name. My dad's in the other room. I'll only stay a sec. <u>What is it</u>? <u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>! This is going too far, young man. But Grandpa, you said... I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil... Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore... Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits. What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around. Theo rode for this place a long time, man. What!?! Try to pay attention. I saw it. Saw what? When dad died, I saw another fire... Everybody did. I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die. ...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there? I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on... Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian. Sometimes right when you're looking at them. Tu sais j'ai r fl chi longuement   ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-m me.  Tiens. Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite? Si tu veux. What's the matter? Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open. You loved the Baron, didn't you? Yes -- So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was. Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that. He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him. I didn't like Preysing right off. Then why did you have anything to do with him? Money! Yes, of course, -- money! You don't understand that do you? Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me? What? You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel. Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always. Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more. Later? When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until... Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days. Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing? Oh yes, of course. Do you like me better? You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man. It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want. See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me. Uh-huh. Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah. Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on. I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir. I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you. Course heading, Captain? Second star to the right - and straight on till morning... Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here. This is where you live? You bet. Whose house is it? What's the matter? How can you ask me that? You're making me feel guilty again. You are guilty. I'm guilty. Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta. I know what I know. And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again? He didn't come! I'm here! You're late! We're here. Jake, is that you? What the hell did you do, move all the furniture? Why didn't you turn on the light? I didn't want to wake you. Gee, thanks a lot. Where is the lamp? Where are you? If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was. I moved the couch. That's all. Where to? Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive. Yes, sir. You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came? Miss Wollsten -  my secretary, she'd know. She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises. Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause. Not feeling too bad now are you? No, sir, I feel really great. Good. Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir? Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex. I don't think I...Larry? I have about seventy-three... Will you take a check? Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest. Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot. I couldn't stop myself. It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do. Yeah, all right, listen... So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.... Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us? Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about. I was? That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother. I don't get it. When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again. I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together? It's crossed my mind from time to time. And...? Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine. Then you think it might have worked out? Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends. He's dying.  And I can't deal with it. But he's never said a word- You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him. Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel. I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared. You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her! No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I -- -- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?! She did! We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you. What would that be, sir? Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself. Of course. Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it. Is there something I don't know about? Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*. Ring the call to quorum. Hi. Hi. Where you going? Going home. Out of self comes selflessness. Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you. Dad? Do you think that Brady will ever get better? One in a million recover. Maybe he's that one in a million! Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line. Don't be a hero... This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here... What is it? It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand. He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile. Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted. You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother   when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit. I'll make you another one. Forget it. ...Well I'll be damned. I couldn't believe it either... I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons. Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ? No.  I see them. See them?  What do you mean? Physically? Yes. The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different. There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar. The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go! I didn't mean to hurt you. Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. You. what? You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease. There's no disease, I can tell you. Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you? I'm glad you do. There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death. Dorothy. no! If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. You called me Jeffrey. I did. are you? Yes. Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok. No. not really.  but also because I really want you to be alright. It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop? Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis... You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June? You are? That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think. About what? About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida. What's in Florida? Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds. Going to catch yourself a rich bird? Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste. You're entitled. Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine. Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller - I want mine to wear glasses. Glasses? Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed? Well, now that you've mentioned it - They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal. Hi. Hi. That's a terrible idea- -is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know. Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that? I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now. I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived. Then we agree. Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis... ... I believe you... ... I'm not sleeping well... ... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that... Bring him out of what? My dream. How you plan to do that? Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up. Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream! If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts. I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway. Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out. What!? You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh? You crazy? Hit him with what? You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile... Meanwhile...? Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight. Spock? Welcome aboard, Captain. What about their philosophy lessons? They're studying with Cynics. Of course... Thanks, Mark. No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood. Sure you do -- you win either way. I'm supposed to. My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote. That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this? They come when you sleep. That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually. I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church. Father, I have nowhere else to stay. You have a sister in New Orleans. Me? My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to. Do you want me to be there? I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand. Third Man. A novel, Mr. Martins? Mace... you're a girl. Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on. Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here? Sure, I've done it easily. Hey Chris, keep an eye on things. ...when I... ...what has she done to harm you...? Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here". Please put your clothes on What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here? I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you. Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there. You're going to listen to me. Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date? They say love is blind. Do you think that's true? Anything else? A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range... Just what you see, pal. ...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus. No again? I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines. Really? I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune. He agreed? He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage. Shelly!  Where are you?! Are you all right, Shelly? They knocked out my tooth! Only one tooth? Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much. If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know. Last word freak. Where's my mother? I dropped her at home. It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you? Is there anything that can stop it? Yes..thank God.. We've met. Have we? No one. But I'm a little nervous. When can you get it here? I'm doing a transfer now. Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone. I'll come straight there. Be careful, Danny. I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb. Yeah. The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes... ...not the Lazyboy... Give me the book. No!  Andy, don't do it -- They're asking for it. But there may be a few around somewhere. What makes you think so? My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know? Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father? Where are we going, Donald? I have the power to build a time machine. How is that possible? Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon. Then how is time travel possible? It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore. When will this happen? Soon. Time is almost up. Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch. What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that? I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband. I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside. Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing? Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled. You stupid son of a... No point in arguing anymore... His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department? No question of her loyalty. Slayers! We must enter the swamp. KILL! KILL! Stop it! Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry. And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me? I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen. Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us! What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore. You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard. That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add. She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there. Hit me! Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load. Boogered! Are you O.K.? Sure. Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for. What do you mean? Trust me... You don't want to see any more. I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl. There's only one I want. Nice town that you've got here. You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof. ...wouldn't that be dangerous? ...not if you've got something to hold on to. That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything. We'll be back before you are, old man. May the Force be with you. Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean? I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me. We stand behind all our work. You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving. What do you do about what? ...I'm looking for someone. Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book -- Bimboo? Dad. I just asked his name. Ellen. Don't be long, Ellen. Look. You're almost one of us now, Michael. So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton. And that was 28 days ago today. Did we get those DNA tests back? Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims. What kind of animal? Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard? When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia. No! What did she want? I did her hair. What were you talking about? Nothing. Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions. She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not. And that was all? No. She asked about the trademark. What did she want to know? She showed me a drawing. You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us. Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough? What do you mean? ...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls. Wasn't it lovely? Aren t you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six. Don t flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too. That's murder! All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover. It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any. I don't think it's Shandor. Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you. You can both go take a flying jump. Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile. You've got something to show me. Yes. Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl. Okay, okay. Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything. I don't understand. Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster. Ah, so I pull the strings! Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good! Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy. Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff. I'm sorry we broke in. No harm. No foul. That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit. That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't? I know. I know. They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it. I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect... Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party. What are you doing, boy? Getting Pearl to bed. I -- What's taking you so long about it? It -- she -- What's that you're playing with, boy? Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward. Come on, children! You're late. I'm sorry. You were never late before, I was worried. Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred. Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes... ...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans. Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit. What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes. They way you drive, I can see why. I...I shot a kid. In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"? No.  Course not. I'm going back for Taylor! Are you nuts!  It's too risky! Think I should buy some originals? ...Do I? Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions. That's insane. You're ahead of your time. That's what I told her. My wife. What are you waiting for? Where do we start? We'll vacuum these streets if we have to. Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young. It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross. You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan. Yeah. You have... you have a husband. I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises. DO YOU WANNA DIE?! No. Yes you do... Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars. Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'. But you're his brother. He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers? No. What makes you so sure it was one? I can't be sure. You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions. We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable... Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys... They are much more than that, sir. Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier... For killing a dolphin. ... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?! You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought -- Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind. We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you? You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money. No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me. Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation. Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore. Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least... Yes, quite. We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane. Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck? Yes. I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck! Nuwanda?  Please? All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove. Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here. Right. Are you two okay? We've been better. What's going on? Michael Myers. Who's that? 10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle. And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about... China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight... They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident. ...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number. Uh-huh. So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet. I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou. Yah? Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR? Oh... Mike!  Mike, can you hear me? I think he's dead! Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away. Robot huh? Kay-em 14. Barbie from hell... Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six... Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie... I'm afraid I cannot assist. Is this real? Yes. I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy? Real McCoy. You're a preacher? I was a minister. Was? As in not anymore? Yes. Why'd ya quit? I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business. I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct? Yes. I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy. How do I know you'll keep your word? Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit. You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth. Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya? Yes. Didn't like it, did ya? No, I didn't. Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning. You won't let him touch her? I can handle Richie, don't worry. Oh, I'll get 'em all. Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive. How am I supposed to transport them? Agnes, did you love your mother? Yes. Did you ever want to be a mother yourself? I could never be a mother. Why not? Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby. Why not? Because I don't want one. If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one? From someone who didn't want to have a baby. Like you? This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...? Rose Calvert. ...Mrs. Calvert? Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you. Aubrey?  It's mommy. Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know. I told you she was innocent. Hey, there was a lot of blood. She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this. I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull? How's the water? Refreshing. ... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me. Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss. Speak English will ya. D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me. I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer, Coulda been a contender. you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman. Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm. You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman. Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline. I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it? 50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes... So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you... It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need? Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise. Spooky. Charlie? No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back. I think he's dead. No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head... I've always wanted to ride one of those.... No way.... Chicken.... ...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>... And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms... How come so many of the books are in Spanish? They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met. Are they still together? He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on. Is he a Nazi? I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that. What's he care about? Killing himself. I can't believe this! I feel faint... Call the police. That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now. Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left? Tell me about your friend Creasy. You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say. I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together. Two tourists who never went home. You helped him get this job. That's what friends do. Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better. I can take care of myself. You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple. The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends. What happened to him? What happened to Creasy? Yeah, well... Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something? Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you -- What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance -- What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms. Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down? They found the safe. You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard? Yeah, hi.  Nice house. Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut. Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart. A prior engagement overcame me. What? Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy. Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband -- How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry -- I just can't believe you could be so -- Two minutes til Krieger shows.  This ll have to be quicker than I d like. Certainly quicker than you d like. Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.. Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, you ve asked the question and you are the answer. In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor. Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him. Go back to sleep, baby. What did you say, sir? See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch? Oh God, just get it over with. You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter. My daughter died long ago. I was hoping we could have a special evening. I won't be late. Did something happen today? No harm, no foul? I guess. And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said. And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and... And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer. ...yes...? But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all. When? But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...? What good will that do? They can deal with this sort of thing. More soldiers? Scientists. Very intellegent men. That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee! Oh yes. Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints .... Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back. You got a live arm there. Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there. Thanks...partner. You need an ambulance. Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading? We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing. I do. Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then? Don't do this. ... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife? You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now. No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you. I can't do it. That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun. What'd you say? I said you're soft. Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that. We can digest our- Okay. Yeah. Jim, where the hell have you been? Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period. Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here. You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now. Where am I? You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work -- <u>Where am I</u>? You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean. How did I get here? You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you? Now are you going to get a regular job? Don't worry. If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff. Yeah, thanks. AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT? The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda! Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge. Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather. You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it. Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech! Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right? Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period. I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period! Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity? I've adjusted, and thanks for asking. I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William". Nobody says you have to be like me. He does. You don't give him enough credit Chas. No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried. Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you. The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said -- You what? I talked to some developers about the land. Listen, I want to talk to you. Not now.  I don't have time. I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man. My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer. You whore!  You filthy whore! What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party? I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people. I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do? Yes sir. I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was   well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou? There. Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section! Did I do good, Mr. Luthor? Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long? How you holdin' up, kid? Fine... That guy's great. Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see? See what? She threw a punch at a man on the team. Well, you know, that happens, on the street. What is that supposed to mean...? I think its meaning is clear. What, you're saying she was overwrought. That could be. Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid. She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And... One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file... We don't have anything from the Nurse Association? The broad has disappeared... The Hospital...? I will not have you use that name to me. You will not have it? Monica?  Who's Monica? A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass. A sweater. And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye. What the fuck is going on. I don't know, but I've got to get on there. You're crazy. Pull up alongside. This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing. John.... Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after? Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble. Thank goodness.  Breaktime. I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal. I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people. Play one.  Educate yourself. Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche? Keefer!..Put this man under arrest! That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws. What are you doing? What? That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport. You're right.  Talking too much again. Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal. What?  You think I'm running you up? Just do your job. What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ... One last time.  It's important ... You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that? I can't tell you ... except only I can do it. You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO! Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here? Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . . The one Superman wrecked up? Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that? You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex. There! You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better? Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night. If you can think of anything else give us a call. You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be. Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys! Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose... Hello, again. I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party. How about a roll in the hay? You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house. . . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers. Yes, but George . . . It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America. At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war. The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war. Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have. Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and -- Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend. Hey, he cheated on her. He made a mistake. I don't want to -- do you know where he is? No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl. No! And that girl has a name. Lucky? You call that lucky? He let me live. He let me be his friend. I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day. Nothing wrong with trying. I don't think my sister would agree. Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep. Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through -- Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand. Hello, Eve. I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck. This is funny. Yeah. This is nice. All this talk about love, it's silly. You don't like me? You hate me? Dad, are you okay in there? Just finishing up in here. Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty. Stop complaining. A gentleman would offer water. Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper? I detest serpents. That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now. What shall we do? Be patient. Only you would think of that! Somebody has to! Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz? I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him. I'm a liberal! No... My car bumper has never held a winning sticker. The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers... Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations... Warp two... three... Steady as she goes... I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay. We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She -- That's not what I mean.  I want to see her. I don't know... Then screw you.  I'll rot. Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you. Whatever. What's it like? It's the most beautiful place in the universe. Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go. The lights come up, you pull the switch. I pull. You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You... No --- how does it go? Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory. Vaaaat??? Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time. But he has long hair! Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory. I don't know.  I don't know. Poor creature... He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right. Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street. Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet? Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man! Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there? Nothing. Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy? I don't see that at all .. Charlie!  I said, what time is it? Half past eleven. I mean in New York. Half past eleven. At night? Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press. Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world. You always said you wanted to live in a palace. Can't we go back, Charlie? ...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer. Who? Please, I want to go back... I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future. But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did. How are ya? Hello. You think I'm lying! No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny... My God, what the hell are you...? Hurry, the woman needs help! What's the plan? Plan? Let's just keep walking. Mind if I look around? Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... Vegas, baby! Vegas! Do you feel much about the things you did? I didn't do anything wrong. Tell that to Muskie. Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff. During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls. Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record. You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians. I didn't. But you know who did. When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful? What brings you out here... Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the... Don't start, alright. Alright. Why so pissed? Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money? We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole. Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost! Sh, sh! Fuck you! Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that. We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about? We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes. Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here? That's the way it is. An' you say no cops? No cop can come in here without a warrant. I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas. They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights. You got dances too? We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night. Say, who runs this place? Government. Why ain't they more like it? *You* find out, I can't. Anything like work aroun' here? Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him. Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time. That cut you got? Crate fell on me. Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight. Goodnight. Escape"? In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild... He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he? Yes, Ben - he is. He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all. I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President. Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him? I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's? He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away. Why? You go in for dangerous things. Darned if I don't! Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come? I don't know why. I just couldn't help it. But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now. I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not... Oh, Sandro... I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye? For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly? It takes even less. But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me? I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together. No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off. And what about you? Me... I... I... Please leave me alone. You live like a pig. Yeah.  How long have you been here? All night. Well... who are those guys? What do they look like?... Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something? Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something. Well, what? Godammit, George... Now wait a minute... Sit down. But... I said sit down! Have a nice trip? Fair. Can I sit down? Why not? We already know each other's secrets. Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast. Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast. Can I buy you another drink? How's Zander? OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him. What about our friend - Sark? Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here. Not us, I hope. Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs. Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening! Neo, this has to be done! Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it? What are you talking about? The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me... So does anybody have any suggestions? We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it. No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out. Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No? I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic. All right. I'll getcha a piece. Yeah... so, listen-you drive? Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving. Oh, you do? Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility. Oh, right. Nice car. Huh? You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich? Huh? Oh, yeah. Wadda you so sore about? Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor? I got it, Mr. Bialystock. Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like. Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo. I already have.  Come on. Oh. Yes. Good. No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down. They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are. That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am. And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it. Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what -- Don't apologize, John. It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close... A castle's but stone and mortar -- Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief... Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both. We'll leave first thing in the morning. We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope. How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily? Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about. We'll see who's dreamin', m'man. The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all. I can handle it. I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame? It's not history. So what do you want? I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it. Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want. Pretty, ain't they? I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile. Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot. Ya nose is broke. Damn! How's it look? Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe. ...The guy's great. Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan! Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe. Who were they?  What do they want with me? We'll explain on the way. Nothing. I dunno-- --you should get back into bed. I guess, yeah. Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa! Got lost in his own museum, huh? Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying. I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits... Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had. That's our plan. Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk. How grave? Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS. Where's my gun? What are you going to do? Shoot him? If he decides to wake up, hell yes! Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces. I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica. Sir. Sir. Hah? We're really in a terrible rush. Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money? Sixty-five. Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93. I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery. Commentary. Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery. No jokes-these are friends, okay? Are you all right? I'm fine. Are you sure? How's your knee? I'm fine all over. Mind if I come in? Of course not. President? When is it? I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do. No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it. Absolutely fine about it. Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'? Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away. Luther was part of the gang? What gang you talkin' about, Jack? I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack. Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'. Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise. ...All right, Eve.  If you say so. ...I do. Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again. Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled. You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original... You're more than modest. It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself. A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion... Please do. I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly... I don't think I've done anything to sound off about. We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will? Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow. It needn't be. Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody. I am somebody. Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me. What friend is that? The one with the shotgun. And why are you so glum? I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless. Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine? Yeah. Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey? Four years.  Which would make her termination date... Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge? Longevity is classified.  No. There's ... another exit? Aye, for us there is. Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen. No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man. You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened! Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes. What? My eyes are not lying! Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes. Why? Good question. You took the bait. See me, sir? You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant? Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert? What? It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this... I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick. Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby. Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him. Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... Welcome to the singles scene. I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie. You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage. We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things. So he started having affairs, and you got depressed. David. Please. This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on. Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan... What's the plan? I drown, you tow me back to the rig-- WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!?? Nell -- -- how much is this car worth? How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me! He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it! Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him. No. What? I never did, Benjamin. Now let's -- Well, wait a minute. You married him. ...wanna savor this. It's gonna get cold. Right. Wait. A toast. You're just afraid to eat it. Hi. My pleasure. Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here. Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver. I can't take this. Ben.  This is business.  Just work. Gabe!? What are you doing here!? Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back. How'd you get up here? Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?! You got to go back now! Where's Hal, what's going on? No. I can feel your desire, Deanna. Yeah? Paulie, you've got kids, right? Well... I need to close now -- You live in that house behind the store? Yes I do. You've lived here all your life? You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it. Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch! Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal. Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am. Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor. Yes, ma'am ! I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact   it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living. Course you do, Jake. An honest living. So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do? You're leaving? Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself... You were going without saying goodbye? I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone. But what about me? I'll say goodbye to you, Tita. Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out. Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs? With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts. As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient. Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom? No. I can't. Not yet. All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early. I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown. Yes. Yes. Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute. But, Mr. Gittes. Sophie. Yes, Mr. Gittes. ...sorry... This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking! I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit. Furtw ngler's in a different category. We're dealing with degenerates here. Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation. Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T. Sid, it's Vincennes. Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy. I'll need more men to look. Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower. We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon. I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start. I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide. Homicide?  A detective? Neil, calm down. Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool. We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool. Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs... I dunno, man.  Maybe we should. We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over. Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you. Yeah... great. You know... you could say thank you. You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me. What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them. You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend -- I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us? You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital. Pacific Coast Bell. This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine. Please hold the line... No such number is assigned. I just called it. No, Sergeant.  I checked twice. A bootleg... Because I want you to tell me. The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here. Can we skip the poetry, inspector? Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been? I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location. We can't shoot the Old Mill. You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy... Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. Two. But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm against that. We've got to get out of this shower. Now you're making sense. Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ... What sort of references do you have? Well, I do Barbara Rush. Pardon me? Her hair, I do Barbara Rush. I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy. Do you have any hot soup? No. What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway? You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff... That lets us off the hook. Jack?... Jack? Shut up! Jack, I'm innocent! Help me. Bastard!!! This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off. What are we going to do!? We're going to keep driving. Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on? Until your confirmation date. Jesus Christ! You can do some crazy things with it. You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds. Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand. Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long. If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long. You're in a rush. Mr. Dumbarton is, yes. My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once. What's Early been in jail for? Carryin' a gun. ...Anything else? An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said. Jeez... Adele! I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years. Relax, I got him. No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world. Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath? Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy? Fraid so. And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you? Obviously. Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go. He survived? The doctor who saved him couldn t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he s a dead man. Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha? No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do. It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime. I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it. Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then? Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn! Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil? This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this. Geccch, yehh, guhhhh! Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it. Uhhh, gahdam stuff! What did you say, Brother? I said ahhh-dam stuff. No, you didn't say that, Brother. Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff. There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here. If there's a way in, there must be a way out. No, that's not true---there's well...no-- I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success. That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly. He wants you to come and see him. He said that? Yes he did. Where is he? He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia. I can't go all the way down south. Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground. There's nothing wrong with me! Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti. You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here! You okay?  huh?  Jimmy? And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us. C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up -- In my sleep, Burt. We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us. It's safe, try it, you'll see. Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources... I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me. One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs. When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades. There you are.  Out you come. Oh my God. Could I have a tissue please? All right. I'll get you a check. I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news? You got something on the Coke? I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life. He's a priest? No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you. My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is. You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that. There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize... Do you want to tell me what you found? Cash, stock certificates, and this... Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks. I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President. Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age. Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed. By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax. Verona's summer hath not such a flower. Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less. Nay, bigger; women grow by men. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? What? We need to get past them. I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail. Which you pulled, hard! That was code for "I like you. What's wrong? Nothing, just lookin'. Because it's cheap like a budgie. And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know. How does she like what in bed? Like what? What, what, what is it?! On the floor!  Get on the floor! Kaggs. Home office. Roy Dillon. I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon. It must be the altitude    you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot and saddle boys -- The whole town's in a state, Kiki   doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep   nobody on the streets at night    Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you. Uh, Captain... PUSH! Uh, Captain... Oh, I'm terribly sorry. My fault. You're not hurt, are you? I don't think so. I wish you'd make sure. Why? Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars. Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. Thank you. Who are you? Now, really - Okay, start pedaling. Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall. Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling. Daddy, I'm scared. C'mon, Chief, show some guts. Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead. Eighteen and a half years. Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred. You're looking good, Auggie. No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin? I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief. And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook? You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth. At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people. I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out. Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears. This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I. You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that? Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting. I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to. But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back. I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once. On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got. If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40. We were getting 50 from our guy. With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40. You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest. I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it -- Actually, I'm free Sunday. Now. Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow. If we don't go now, it won't happen. Where is Michelle? There. Truly - uh - splendid. Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife -- Uh-huh. Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that. You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all. Well, how about this? Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you. Oh, yeah. My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it. I'm here with you. I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love? accompanies Hilda into the hallway. breaks down into heavy sobs. How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice. Yeah? Have a brandy? Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open. I thought it was because we let you win at roulette. That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa. Yeah? What's his name? Victor Laszlo. Victor Laszlo? Unfinished business. Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie. Who's she? I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top. Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing. As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration. Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her. Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this. Willing? I like that.  And, this one? That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met. What's this? What's the matter? What happened? It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off. What! Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*! Art thou the King of the Jews'? Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me? Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy? I don't see that at all .. Bring the light! What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> -- Leave the sled, let's go, go, go! So, Mark's working at the State Department now. Really?  What do you do there? Your majesty, I really think you... My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you... ... as always, majesty... ... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone. Okay. Get him in here. You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option. What? Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop. Nobody escapes us. HE did. I've seen him. How's he not your husband? I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want... Right. I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift. Where're you going, Ichiro? The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich. I had better sex in prison. Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig. You share a place with T-Bone? No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that. I understand completely. Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...? And I need a drink. That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high. He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor. Interesting theory. Where's the proof? I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer. No it's not. It was Jason. Afraid not. It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason. Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel. Hey, try swimming. It works. What the fuck are you talking about. Swimming, you know, like in water, moron. Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO? Er, yes.  Speaking. Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking! and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there. I thought you said you weren't going there. Why, you said... Never mind. How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion? He doesn't know. Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes. Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything... Well, there's nobody special! Fine. I mean, it's not easy in this day and age. What? Meeting ... people. Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that. I never really...went through a... dating period. It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything. Hear that?  Are you hearing this? No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay. It won't run a week! Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act. Who wrote it? What kind of a girl are you, anyway? Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution. You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant. Hey, how ya doin', cutie? Okay. How you doing? Just great!  See ya around! Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful. What? Bye. Monica! The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come. Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out. Jesus. You can do it. I'm John McClane. Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag. I feel cold. This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. Peter, you're bleeding. It's fine.  Tell me what-- Oh, Ben gets through everything. Aunt May, what happened? I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me. How is he? He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine. Can I speak to you in confidence? Huh? Oh. She's alright. I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out.... We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong? Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage.... Private eye? You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding. What are your rates? $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer. What have you got on Miss Mayfield? Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon. I said I was sorry. You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers. You're not funny. Ouch! Detective, does it look like a murder? We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done. How many victims are up there? There are two bodies found at this point. Can we go up to the crime scene? You know you can't do that.  C'mon. Is it drug related? We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know. I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts? Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation? Hey, I got no choice. Gee, I wish I'd been there. I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve. Pure politics! An attempt to ruin us! Help! Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me. The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river. Keep Charley out of this. You don't think he'd be  helpful? Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself. Maybe I will  one of these days. One of these days. I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this. It's okay--I don't mind. Dad. Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man. Dad!! Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books. She called you 'George,' George. ...did I win some contest? A cop? I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled. Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth? You're a cop - you'll never believe me. Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak. Don't want weak legs. Can't fool around -- You look very great. -- The legs. Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know. Oh my God, we're too late! Mr. Sulu: full power descent! What are you doing? I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped. But they don't have a case against you. Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ. Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?! Don't make no difference no more. Can't you get the money from your friends? What friends? The primo stuff is great for pain. I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms. All I have is hundreds. I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry. Bullshit, you don't. The fat man down there, on the bench. Perfect. Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal... Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details. Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask -- Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your -- O-kay.  We'll skip that question. Here, aren't you gonna let me in. Try calling me again. How come you took your own car? I didn't want him meeting me here. Well that's something. What is. You didn't plan on fucking him tonight. Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it? Run for what? Can't you see?  It's raining! So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple. Simple. Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa... Lemme tell it, Tommy. Okay. We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa. So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu? I told you. Filet and salmon. Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry? I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish? Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference. Let me call Christine. Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste. I owe her a call anyway. Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question? Yea, James. What are we going to do with... What is it? Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226. Have you used this type before? But it was all we had. ... but it was all we had. Hi. Hi. Huey 205, isn't it? Right on. You fly? Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days. All right, then this is old stuff to you. Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...? You can do it. Because I'd met someone else. Oh <u>okay</u>. You believe that? I do if you do. on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops. Yes, M'sieu Laval? Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute. Hmm. I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study. No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something. What the hell are you doing there? Did you and your sister often take naps together? I want you back in your chair! Right now! I'm asking you to leave. Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving... ...Not until I get a little something to remember you by. Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!! All you all right? I'm fine.... Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you? For the moment. And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect! It don't work- Ain't that a shit-- Good thinking. You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan... Forget it. Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying. I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank? Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone. I thought so, too. Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times. Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out. PE? What? You guys doing gym class? No man. PE -- "political education. Don't worry, I'll be right back. Come on. [Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie. Ok. I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry. Is that what you came here to say? Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son. Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system. You don't have the authority to do that. Be careful, Julie. I've got to see. What happened?  Where's the rest? I guess that's all of it. I don't know what to say. Say you were wrong. I was wrong. Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself. I did.  Both. Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this. The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history. That's not Fred Madison? No, sir, it's not. Who is it? I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson? Yeah, Mack? Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here. It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you. It's a little late. Hammer? How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go... What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart. Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair. My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash. I would hardly say you look like trash. No thanks to you. How come you never talk? She was born without a tongue. Oh my God!  Sorry. But, I don't understand. And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why. Well, in that case...of course, son. The Penny Saver sucks. Yeah, but it sucks for free. It hit? Nnnnnnn! Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on? Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end. I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say. Everybody love Linda. That's right. That's exactly what I mean! I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much! Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda -- How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda? You mean...? I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right? Oh God, we can't get out! Nell, what do we do? Thank you. honey. It's okay. It's okay. It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell. Can't this thing go any faster? You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything. They don't know this. And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman? Dad... All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you. We need guns. We don't need guns. I'm pretty sure we do. I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him All the more reason. You wouldn't even know where to get one. Wanna bet? You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun? That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden. It was six in the fucking morning. Float me a hundred bucks. Why? You wanna see how fast I get a gun? You're out of money? No. What do you have left? Eighty. Eighty bucks?!? Eighty five. What happened to the fifteen hundred? You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while. I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks! You did? Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room? What about it? They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker... Score! Yeah! Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty. I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache. A headache? I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system. The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident. Thanks. Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant. Through a wound on his stomach? Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey. You said you had no whiskey. Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio. She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							* I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there. But he's not the right guy!					  * Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard. What about you? Where are you going? Back to work. So what'd the other guy look like? Never saw him, was your basic hit and run. But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away? I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do. Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm. What are you doing here? Otto called - If you're going to openly be a bitch.... I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people? Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad. Now--turn around, if you would. Turn around? I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around. I'm Kathryn. Annette Harrison. They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which. Well, I suppose... Yo-yo-yiggity-yo. I am a suicide risk. Is this Juno? No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting? Only the one in my pants. Dude, I'm pregnant. Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch? It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout. How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests? I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier. Is this for real? Like for real, for real? Unfortunately, yes. Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take. Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke. I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now. Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year. Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent. So you're still on the Zoloft? Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf. Yes! Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes. You don't need me... Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail. Take care, Wade. You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know. Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest. Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month. Mama, why did they take Daddy away? Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child. Is he gon' be gone long? Might be... No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks. The socks?  It's cold in here. You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on? We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong? Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me? What? We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium! What? Where to? Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour. The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James? I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your... Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth. Thank you. Who needs to repair a leaky church roof. You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing... Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend. That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me. Then what kinda stuff can we do? Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know. It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh? Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me? Sure. We can practice talking. Okay. You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop? No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop. And bring the cocktail shaker. Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise. Today ain't my day. Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day. You never thought of the possibility? Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me! But, Leon, I am only here for a few days. If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here. Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian. Come on! Where's Kelly? She's with Sarah! Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment... Attempted murder. I told him to be himself. He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak. She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area -- A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so -- Dysfunctional -- That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together -- And glow happily ever after. She finally got in-- It's Saturday. You got in late last night. Yeah. I had uhm--school business. What are you doing? I bought a couple of tickets. But this is a porno movie. No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them. The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera! I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from? Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you. Me?! Naturally. Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that . Yeah. I'd have to bleach my hair. Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee. How tall are you? God... What? I used to eat there... Really good noodles. How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite. Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands. How can you be so certain? The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras... Esdras is a Jew. So was Christ! Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty. Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you? First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that. Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning? As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it. Come on, that's impossible. Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible. Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes. That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him. But if he said no before then... Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while? Then I don't understand the reason for the delay! You don't have to understand. And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve? I have a purpose. Then perhaps you will enlight- en us? Silence, Romulan! Hey, what kind of swag did you score? Yeah. Mall madness, huh? Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about. That's too bad. It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year. They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh? Temporarily. I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do? First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings. I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7. Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good? Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. Okay. You better get out before someone sees us. Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies? Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going? Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh... Duty?!  You talk about duty?! If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do. I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time -- Have I ever let you down before--? -- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me! I'm breaking no promises! You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most! For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe! I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it! No, not really. Any books you like to read for fun? No. None at all? How about those 'underground' comics? I hate reading. All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere. OK. OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have? I dunno... C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking. Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman. Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal? I dunno. See if I have any connections. What is it? Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone. Really. You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion. What kind of jewel is this? I don't know. You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this? No. Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity. And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money. And what did they say? The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right. You have such a head for knowing. You know everything. I brought you something. Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me. Okay. All right.  And what do I say? Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be. I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war. This is terrible! And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered. I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there. Fuck!  Oh, shit. Oh, we're screwed, Night... ...Shift. You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! I think... ...we can make it. You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?! Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons! Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!  Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies! I don't think we have much of a choice... ...do we? Oh, shit. That's right.  Now,  move!   Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Captain... Worf, what the hell are you doing here? How did you get off the island? Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold. Don't you have a concert to go to? That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true. I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition. How awful.  What will you do? A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist. DONOVAN! Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones? Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school. How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school? Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now. Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice. Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you? I guess I ain't. Why? Don't you believe in the Lord? Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad. I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune. I doubt it. I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other. I guess not. And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter. Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it! Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it. O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours! Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you? I... I don't believe this. Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did. Who the hell is this "they? Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings? No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying! So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization. Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway. You should watch what you say. I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist! Kid, that cuts no ice with them. What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one? They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know. Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes! Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix. I was decorated. I know.  A Purple Heart. Exactly. You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk. At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career! You can't testify. Why not? I float.  You sink.  End of story. I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn. It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot. Shut up. Those are my friends. Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean. Can we do any better? I don't think so. I see you're still having problems with your openings. And this Jeremy-- --Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you? Want a spike in it? No thanks. That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning? You figured that out, huh? Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to... Steady on, Treves. Have a seat. Oh, my, what's that ? Looks like rain. This time of the year...? So -- how long will you be gone this time? Gone? Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment? I'm not going anywhere. You always say that -- then you leave. Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful -- You can't talk about my brother like that... Here we go... You're scared. I'm not scared. Neither am I. Maybe you should be. He can protect us, Claudia. You really believe that? You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives! That land belongs to the strongest. We didn't think this through very well. My father had this friend... He was an inventor... What's goin' on, Elly? I went to see a friend of mine. Well, how's your friend? She's still dead. No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I. I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off. How well do you know her? Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead. Who with? A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother. Oh, you infant! How much did you lose? Lose?--I won a little-- That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again-- What do you know about them? Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl-- You can live that down, can't you? He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you! Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs. You keep logs?  My, how organized. Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian. Never heard of that system. Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable. A mining colony. A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back. Can you trust him? No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ... Hey... Dewey. Can we go now? Hold up a sec... Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you! You gonna beat me, Joe? Beat your butt, you don't lemme think! Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem? I show you what problem -- Yes, Albert? John,we're going huntin'. Who's going? We're all going. Nick's going? Nick, Vince, Albert and John. No women? He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis. Marty. Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years. I'm sick. Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding. No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No! Here you are! Two rich people! I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried. You brought a case? Good. Sit down. I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand. Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have. I can't split them. And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo. Every day you meet quite a few. You got your room straightened out yet? It's getting there. We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight. Oh no, it's been much more than that. Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all. I don't think that's true. It is true. Besides being very rude. Please, I don't use guns. There is nothing to it. Neil, do you mind? Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!  and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out. Stewart! This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that. You can't walk out of here like this. That help? Thanks. Executive clemency ... What? Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned. I like that.  That's a solution. Why don't you take a rest, Brian? I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted. Go on, you're tired. No, I'm fine, thanks. Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all. Congratulations. You should spit in my face. Excuse me, Colonel. We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless. I don't understand. Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing. But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you. He knows me? He says he saw you in a vision some time ago. Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth. I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office? I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it-- Nice place. He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride. How long you worked for Mr. Whale? Long enough.  Fifteen years. I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars? No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone? You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri. Your wife? I'm not married. Why? Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me? A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman. You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you? Yes? I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so. Someone you know? Yes. Pulse, slow, very little pressure. Look at that right eye. Epidural hematoma? I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you? Not enough to be a pro. You needn't be so frank with me about your work. Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live. You know where I live? We're both professionals, Oatman. I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families. So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around? Yes. Mmm. Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl. It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center". Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details -- Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him. Maybe afterwards he'll let me ... If you free me, you'll be a rich man ... Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me. All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition. I'm all ears. We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down. Shit. Was up bitch? Did he die in the fire? He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered. That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some. You go to Xavier High School, Daryl? Yeah. You remember Mary Finelli? What are you saying? You know what I'm saying. No, I don't. Well, I think you do. Alright, I'll talk to her She's waiting in the conference room. Will you stop and tell me what's wrong? I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong. you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you? yeah, I had a bad night. You want to talk about it? My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her. WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet! Then how come she knows what's going on? C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. They'll kill me. What are you doing? Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them. Balefire on you, Selena! You Scorpios can never take a joke. You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened. I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people. ...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do. Thanks a lot, Buddy. Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work. Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds. I see the change in you -- I see it. Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now. Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago... No. Thank you. Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? Only if you grab my ass. I cannot ignore the verdict of my council. Surely you can do anything you want. Hello, Marty, when you come home? We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School. Try holding the match like this. This is gotta be a game, right? This I gotta see. Ouch! Oh, are you all right? I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose. No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can. Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos... He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when -- Is he Italian? No, why? You sure he's not Italian? He's Black, OK? Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something. As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them. Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic. Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary? I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief. First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it. With the other hand, right? No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point. I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at -- No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure. Show me how he did that again. Why don 't the Zulus attack? Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses. Stuart? Yes. How quickly can you move your artillery forward? Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while. Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. . Right.  Bombardier, to me please. I have to go, I'm sorry to say -- Be sorry for nothing. Almost done. Ow! Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming. Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten. Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies. Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies? Jack!! SAM! What a surprise! Are you officer 412/L? Yes. I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary. I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor. Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have? Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it? Yes, of course. I'll get it for you  Isn't this great?  They have everything here. Yes, it's-it's wonderful. What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book? I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house. It is not.  Get out. I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color. Get out. Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ? My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny. Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --! Don't say that! Well, what am I supposed to think? I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that? How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope? No, I don't think so. I -- Hell! What is it? I don't think that bit's right. What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler? No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you. I thought as much. Absinthe? You gave then absinthe? No. Laudanum. I think he's got a terrific personality. You know, he was formerly a sailor. Do we have anything on the budget today? I don't think so. No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ? Here in Buenos Aires. Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary. I was just going to! Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible? I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up. The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka -- They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do -- ...Feels like you. Case... Shhh... So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson. What about the radio? Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times. And, if it's a threat. We put her in a safe house. Admiral on the bridge! As you were, Mr. Saavik. Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well. Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son -- Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off -- Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again! Ed -- You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show. Ed -- No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me. Yeah? Well I'm not starting now. What is that? Our greenhouse. Oh, I like that very much. Yes, so do we. Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy-- If the next guy's a redneck. --but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout. Good deal you were born down here, then. You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar. You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job. Take that pair over in the corner-- Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty? I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him? Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people. I'm working for his daughter. That right?... She used to be some looker. She ain't exactly long in the tooth now. She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four. You must be thinking of a different daughter. No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away. She ran away? Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing. You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos. I'm still not clear on Chaos. It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine. -- gee... -- what? I don't know what gets into me. You were great. No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester. No you didn't. You don't think so? I do. You were great. You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I? Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen? Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on. There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter. I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard? Some crazy guy. But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair. Then one day they find you. They open a window. We're very unhappy. What do you expect?  You're dead. Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me! Stop, please! I don't know! Prepare a tear harness for the female... No! I swear I don't know! Please! Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship? Where're you going to go? When I get set, I'll send for you. I don't think that'll happen. You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways. You're not a man because of a job, Duff. You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit. Why are you trying to kill us? Because you're looking for the Holy Grail. My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too? No. Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me! If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die. Then we'll die. My soul is prepared. How's yours? Who are you ? I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry. I don't scare that easily. I have a way with animals. It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you. Oh yes. I forgot. I couldn't save them. Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you? I just wanted to know where Mom was? Oh.  Sorry. It's okay. She needs to be alone, I think. Because Dad left? She's a little sad, is all. I don't even care if he ever comes back. Where are we? Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in. You don't have to do this. Do what, show you a good time? I'm not good company. I should be alone. I don't think so, but if that's what you want... Okay, one drink. What do you want? A beer? A beer.  Of course. Fine, then how many nights home is that? Keep your voice down. Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love? Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who? If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and... Hush, sweetheart. You should come into the shelter. I'm quite all right, thank you. Look over there. Mr Greenleaf. Tom. How are you? You look well. I'm well, thank you. Far cry from New York. Yes it is. Marge, good morning. Unusual weather. Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector. Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch. How do you like your bath, sir? I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath? You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird. Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help. Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way. Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop. I guess not. That must be him. Yeah, air. Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air. How you know?  It could be anything. I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look. Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished. Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory? Oh, yeah. That's Maya. You know her? Sure I know Maya. You know that chick? Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half. She is very hot. And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock. What about the shoes? Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you? They knocked out my tooth! Only one tooth? Austin, may I have a word with you? Of course, luv. Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten. I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection? Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic. No, did you use a condom? Only sailors use condoms, man. Not in the Nineties. Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me. Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man. It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me. You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely. We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions. Well, we won't do any of that shit! Mac, can you hear me?  Come in? Taylor, you surprise me. I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank. Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home. Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ... Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad. I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap. The car for Debbie? I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie. Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie? C'mon Tim, move down, damn it! Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick! Kruger, Sagittarius. Commissioner, Aquarius. Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime. Did he put you up to this? Who? Graham. No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all. I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him. If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure. God, you... you're mean. I know. Will you please leave now? Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk. John, we have nothing to talk about. I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated. No, John, things are getting real simple. Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate. How about rapacious and love- starved? No. It is easier to be killed by a terrorist -- It is not -- Right, right. I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George. Thanks. Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting    to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey. What are you doing? Let's just do it and get out of here. Latitude 47 degrees. Wait a second. He knows I know. Fucking Zombie. The scar. There is no scar. I'm telling you. Lowell. Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break! Lowell. These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line! Lowell! What? I'm with Don on this. ...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money? Honey? Mm. Ok. Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?! No honey. You are upset. I'm not. I thought you'd be pleased. I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep. And what's your line, Mr. Meadows? Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game   door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise. Do you want some mustard with this? No, thank you. [The girl's. Pinta's.] [You're a liar. Pinta's dead.] [I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.] Sometimes every day, for a while. Then you don't see him for a few days? High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too. Come here... ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by... You can't sing at the competition. I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it... ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy. Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later. My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it. WHAT  ? You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time. What else is new? Next time we'll bring more blankets. That would be nice. Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow. That would be nice, too. This is serious, son.  A man is dead. I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something. You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you. You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out. Oh no...I think there's carrots in here... Send it back if you don't want it. Addison-! So full of meaning, fire and music! Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now... Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent. You can't walk me home. Why not ? I thought you were going to help Carl. Carl can wait. Johnny, my Dad's home today. Shut up, before you lose them all! These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them -- Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends. Did you now? I liked it.  We all did. Did anyone laugh? No. Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays. Why?  Was it supposed to be funny? Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood. They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them. Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry. Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group. Saddle up, boys, that's our trash ! Where are you, Walker? You're getting warmer! Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike. And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness. Dunbar. Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events. They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world. So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story -- Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin -- Buttfucks the cabin? And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending. So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber? That bugs you too? Little bit. Let's go talk to Bill... Would they go over my girdle or under? Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather. to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious. You have no idea. to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything? How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it. He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that. And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out. If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise. No suicide. Did we ever really think it was suicide? You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake. And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream. I'd like to pay you for that laptop. It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector. That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted. Not really to live, just to play. That building? Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them? Should I? Okay, explain. I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together. For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out. Sounds like he wanted to get caught. Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do. This is incredible.  I know kung fu. Show me. Where did you go when you left here? I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham. What the hell you doin'? Shut your ass up and grab the wall! Now what's the problem? The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people. It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling... Well, Officer, don't worry ab... If there's anything I... How was the flight, Champ? Very high an' very fast. Um-hm. Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black! Oh, my goodness ... How about you?  Are you going to win? You should ask Bobby. What a chase! No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back. Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum . ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT? Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone. Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>.  - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!! <i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you. I'm not going! You don't have a choice. Mom...please. ...we had to lick his boots clean. He was your snitch. Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars. And one good guy. Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it. Hello everyone. If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick. You didn't do your homework? Noooo... Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the... Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough. You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen. Thanks. You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT? Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me -- BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM. I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive. We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>. Yes? And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase. Why me? Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand? ...very good. Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell. ...why? Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles... You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why? Now, whyn't you help us? That would adversely impact my income. Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income. We could skip the Gavotte. Say it in English. Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...? Then who's buying it? There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... <u>That's</u> the spirit... ...aren't you afraid of me...? You want me to be? I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise. Everything okay, son? Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys. Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today? Today? Started off great... Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information. She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been. I don't even know what I'm looking for! Fuck it! Hold tight! Wow. You like it? Please, sir!--come with me! No, Jeff--please--! I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come! Uh, Udall? Carol the waitress? Yes. This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea. Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous. Then where's the chip. So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right? I'll be there. And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay. Bye. Throw it up or I'll kill her. You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash! The money! WHEN SHE'S SAFE! Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe? Bloody big if it is.  Top's open. They'll do it. Great. And your all set for the performance? Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical. Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here. Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven... Heaven? I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it... I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave. I guess there's probably a story behind that. There is, but it's not that interesting. So where have you been staying? The bus station. Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory. Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself. That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st... I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over. Coming right to us! No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back --- Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner. Right. See how your story ends. Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican? ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt. What the-- I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt. What the hell are you talking about? I thought we were going to talk. Last night. Oh. Well. I... What can I do for you, Mr. Welles? Call me Tom. Alright, Tom. What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens... There are reasons for the way we do things here. Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out... I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead. Why don't you go to the police? You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right? If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe. The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him. What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live. It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet. It looks like they've met in this apartment. That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe. Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong. Let's not get too idealistic. Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive. Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...? Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!? It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan! But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>?? The monkey, of course. It was his idea. Monkeybone...!? Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want. You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>?? Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice! It used to make me laugh, but. I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy. Yes. Frank-- Frank is coming? No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me. I sure don't hate you. I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong. That's good. The suspense is killing me. Harry called. And? Lucy overdosed. But she's alright. She's in ICU. The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe. Dewey, there's no such place. Humor me, Sid. We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours. Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!! I know what you're like .. How d'you know what I'm like? Ross told me. Really? What did he say? He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick. He said that? What else did he say? Just your age. Which is what? Fifty-seven .. I don't mind .. He is a cute thing. He's your cute thing. I can't even keep fish alive. A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish. And for you -- Her own movie theatre. I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond? I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself? No. All right.  I'll give you a few more clues. No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here. All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases? Come on, Joe. Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not? If you love me, Joe. Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable. Joe, I can't look at you any more. Nobody asked you to. Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army? I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say? Major. Helmuth. Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games? Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand? We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either. The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss. If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too. What makes you think I'll miss? Like I said, it's a business deal... Damn, you are the real thing... What the hell is going on?!!? Jason, what have you gotten us into? That would be Beaumont Livingston. That's him. How do you know 'em? I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday. Ordell pick up his bond? Same as you. Ten thousand. The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont. You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal. I didn't? No, you didn't. What branch? Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Getting a reading? It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe. Well, thanks a lot. Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on. Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would. And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you. xxxxxx... xxxxxx We've got six hours left. Oh my God. Does anybody know what happened? Eddie... Mom? I'm at the hospital. What's the matter?! He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart. Oh God. What hospital? St. Joseph's. I'm coming right over. I'll be right there. Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley? Yes. Where did you meet him? I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there. What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley. We dated for about a month last year. Then what happened? I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it. Maybe there was traffic. Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy! She hasn't got any. She MUST have a knife or something... You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him... Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water. Robert-- Where's Stacy? She doesn't want to talk to you. What are you talking-- She can't talk to you right now. Why? Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole. Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity... Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why. I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space. Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way. I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me. That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings. You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you? Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there. It's warm. James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat. Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi... Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever. That's the plan.  My word on it. -- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix. When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ... I'm gonna need more caps. You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park. Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys. No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire. Isn't that awfully forward? We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come. Who you calling a "boy"? See ya at the yard, Meat. Here we go again. He's really cute! Almost there, Louis. You keep saying that. This time I mean it. Where are my supplies? I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty. You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey? No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests. ...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me. Threw' you?  Where? Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything -- I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him. So there's nothing between you and Susan? No. I wish you had said something to me about staying here -- It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for? Why? It was a test. For what? We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him! You really care for him, don't you, Eve? I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey... I think we'd better go look for him.  David! Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly. You! You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ... And Tracy's on the move ... Sure. Thanks. Are you all right, Marty? All except my legs... I don't think I can walk. You're a real booger, you know it? We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group. We're very evolved. I'm sorry; of course, you know that. Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy. Connie's outside. Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor. Where did he conduct? On the Baltimore and Ohio. Oh. I play the ukulele.  And I sing too. What's that? Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you. Big-ass titties? Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender. How can I give you this statement? We'll lower a basket from the window ... Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ... I told you what I want.  Lock the door! James, why don't we...? Lock it now! Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing... She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see... ...we had a script conference... I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because... You know what, by God? What? You know what we ought to do tonight? Please Doyle, don't. Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would. Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle. You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low. Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car? It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold. No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean? Is anything wrong? No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs! I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya? What do you want, a joke? No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there? Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking. What?  Beth?  My Beth? Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball. Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted. Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do. I seem nervous, huh? Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone. There is a man's arm in my bed. Why so nervous? I've never done this before. How have you dumped girls in the past? Screening calls. Any suggestions? I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance. See you're back and still rocking the boat. Somebody's got to. Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them! What above the curves?! Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments. Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot. You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for. Really? I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon? Sure -- I guess. Terrific. Hey, it's Jessica. That must be her boyfriend's car. I told Boyd two fucking minutes! What money? I have your samples ready. Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going. No, but you might need them when you get back. SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT You're quite a housekeeper. I told you, I ... I know.  It happened by itself. Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid -- My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker! Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink? No, I don't. So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls? I certainly was not! You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking? One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking". Could you tell me where you were last night? Here.  I played Gregory Lutz. I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that? To my room and then I went for a walk. Sure don't. See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option. And how many room got TV, Dusty? Ever durned one. Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France. The Scots will fight for us? What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve. But if we have not caught Wallace -- He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower? Brill? Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter. What seems to be the trouble, ladies? Whyn't you mind your own business, chief. What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay. I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'. But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out. All but me! I'm a-stayin'. Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might. Theo's dead. Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow. That's right. I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software. I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control. Because you cut it from the budget three years running. How soon will you be able to decode it? ...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial... I doubt we'll have to go to trial... ...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way. I completely understand... We just... I've heard your tapes on the phone. Oh yeah. When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes .... Uh. huh. It's interesting. Mmm. Elaine. Te...! That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk. No. I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm. Alma!? I uhh I don't think... What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs! Uhh... I with it sister but... But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either! Next time, call... I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you? That was a great idea, Shorty. I told you it would taste just like chicken. Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour! I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view? You tell me. I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   * So where're we going? Anywhere but here. She's doing this to get back at me For what? I mean at you. For what? I don't know.  You're her brother you should know. Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me? It'll be okay. He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare. What is it, Skipper? We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there. Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes. Carter, can I have a moment? Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar. Grammar. That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then? No. Where were you? Detroit. With Ordell? We had done time together already. I thought I was here to meet women. Not that one! I like her. And don't be so obvious! Jack. Yeah? Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here? Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior -- You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper -- Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur. Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him? Ask Monsieur Rick. Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time. Boring. Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub. Jesus. Write, write--"I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out. They ready, Earl? They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit... Jay... how's it coming on the repairs? Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out... And when will you be ready to do that? Oh -- I'm not near ready yet. Then why the hell are you sitting around here? Right. You believe me, don't you? What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes .. They're having a laugh... WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody! That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on! This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him? They told me. I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe.

As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records? They didn't look like medical files to me. Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming. Regards to Her Majesty. Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened. He said to follow him. Follow him where? Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end. Hi. Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow? ehh...I don't know I mean.... Your feet are cold. Go back to sleep. I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes. You all act like two roosters. I'm not going to let him get away with murder. You and Babe Brother are so much alike... He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him. Hush. You're always taking his side. Hush. I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him. You're going to find yourself on the floor. And your sushi was remarkable. The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi? N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots. Who did the sushi? Very big beads.

Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him? Yes? Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle! Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle. ...I got lost, Mister. Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything. It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch. Look, I really don't know your daughter but... But what? I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life. What makes you so sure? You wife isn't dead is she? You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing. I'm sorry? What are you oozing about? That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day. We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest. Come on you jerk.

I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb. The retard over at Molly's fruit stand. Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement.

Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source? They were all French guys. French guys?    You mean like from France? Yeah, French guys from France. What'd they take? Everything. Everything? Everything. Boy, you must be pissed. Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me. Well, I must say you're handling it very well. You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me. Okay boss.   Where are they? If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you? You didn't say find them. You said, "get them. Just find them! Okay boss. I got him on the knee! You missed him! God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate. Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me. My God. Alan! Where did you hear that name? Well, isn't it -- ? The name of my User, yeah. But how... ? I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...? Morning honey. Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight. Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd? Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that? Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it. You're not looking too good. Whoa, I just...I just... Oh God, Lins... I-- Tell me later. Oh! Oh, oh! I feel faint.

Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne. You know what he is talking about here? Go with him, Rose. Go with him. Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all. Oh -- Oh, come on. Huh?  What'd he say? A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today. What'd you do? Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker. I guess he got the message... Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do... Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you. Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit? I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it. If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference. Hey, you know what I really think? Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it. I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em. Good day, Mr. Chance. Good day, Sally. I see.  Did Chloe testify? I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around... Jasmine...

I will give you his answer tomorrow. Are you feeling better? I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me. You're very fond of Anna, aren't you? Yes, very much so. Has she ever spoken to you about me? Occasionally, but always with affection. And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her. I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening. Can I talk to you a minute? Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there. The leaves... Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast. Look for antiques... Yep.  There's some great places nearby. Adamant. What?

In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball. You been in the Majors? Yep. Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply. You would, huh? Sure.

Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?

The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you. You think that's funny No. You think you are ready now? Yes, my lord. Let's see. I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time... That's all going to change, Yori... How? Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to Really? Uh huh. Sure thing, killer. What can I do you for? Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes. How many you need? What's with the bars? S'curity. What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark. That's just it, Michael.  We don't! What do you mean, we don't? This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long! Thirty feet??? I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you. Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here. You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and   I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail. Look at this guy. Yeah? What can I do? There is something I want.  A friend. Friend? A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me. Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking. I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein. And if I consent? We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow. You okay? Where do we go from here? I don't know, airport I guess. They will have our description before we can get a plane. Yeah. See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that. I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box. Oh, that would be wonderful! Well, we're here to help! You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes. How do you stop The Screamer? You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't... Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell. How bad will it be? Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble... Uh, we uh- We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well. Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that? The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service. What about easier to hit in an air raid? Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh? Yeah. We got a saying here.  A-low-HA! Come on man! No! You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. . They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why? Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach. You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about. Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops. Uh-huh.  Jad? Sir? Go back to work.  All of you. ..I'm fine..and you? I'm fine.. What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank? No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU. Nonsense, I... It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think! Doesn't that tell you something?! Yeah...They should've paid their bill. Mrs. Silvera? Mrs. Silvera. Take me somewhere. What? Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here. How about Italy? Yes. How about Bari? Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train. Have you ever been to that station? Yes. You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas... You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah. Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime. Eddie Lovell. How old are you? Ten. What makes Sammy run? My name is Eddie. What makes Sammy run? I said my name is Eddie Lovell. Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me? How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying? Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor? Fifty cents. You got a deal. Are you okay? I'm fine. Do you want me to stick around? It's okay. Or I could come back. Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something... That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death. I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But... That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing? Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator. Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to... Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally. What do... I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone! This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have? To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now. So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me? Why am I gonna mention your name? How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...? How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson? It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences! And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it? You came all the way down here to tell me that? No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people. I can't move. Just relax. What's happening? Help me. So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother? No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows? Um, yeah sure, I guess. You sure do a lot of guessing. I found this at your brother s. Disney! How inter... It s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I m told it retails at around  4,000.  I see you don t require a definition. You... You found that at Leon s? There s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for  15,000. Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to? How I make my living, what's your point? This. Letty, you should be in bed. There's a spider in my room. Yeah? It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me. Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out. You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals. Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship. This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think. How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle? Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you. By all means. I could stay here forever... I don t think I d fight you on that one... I'm terribly sorry. -- never mind. What does he do? Is he an actor? -- no. Good for you. He's a hairdresser. Claudia, listen to me... No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor... Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought-- I know. How's it going -- ? It's arright ... Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too? I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart. Yes? How's Broussard? He's running a fever. Still unconscious? Yes. Can you do anything for him? The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong. Good. When was the last time I wore pink? The Mitchell barbecue three years ago. Oh shit... Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal. You got kids? I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again. Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance? No. Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie? If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep. OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second... You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him! Sue me. It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport. Sport, indeed. The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face. Blackheart.  Aptly named. Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn? Unicorn? A promise is a sacred oath. All right.  I'll show you something sacred. Speak! Go on.	Speak again. My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor! There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking. Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat? After you, Doll. I think what Eddie wants to say is -- No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese. I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee. I'll come with you. I think I can probably do that on my own. It's too late. Too late for what? They only dump the water at night. There was some trouble here   the villagers on the mainland  -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here   broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves. All the graves? I'm afraid so. There were rumors   people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions. I donut understand. Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream. Bad? Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards... I must really be slacking off.  Hungry? Uh...sure...I...what? Sushi. Environment.  That's cool with me. Okay. Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting. It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38. So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all? Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new. When are you coming home? You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know. Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit. Okay. I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end. Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this? Go away. I might hurt you. I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you. Peter I love you too but... I don't think you'll hurt me. Purpose of visit? A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove. You're late. Yeah.  Should be on the road. Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh? Real charmer. I'll take you down there. All right. Goddamn it! More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die. I think we were wrong about Tex having the money. Why? I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it. I've looked, Adam -- you know I have -- Where's that airlines bag? Lord, you're stubborn. I sure am. Get it. Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it. Alright, alright. Don't you think you should at least wave? Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I? Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us. You're just saying that. You take care. If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here. You... Me. Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk? Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man! Huh? Jim... he <U>wants</U> it. You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission. He's recovering on the third floor. Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic! Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious? All right, just a few questions. I'd like to ask you about your hobbies. I did? Yeah, you did! Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God! Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and... Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator. Page boys! Patrizia, what are you going to do? What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something. I'll go and get my valise. Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that? I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett. Yakuza. Good.  Very good... You were late. I'm really sorry. What am I going to do? You want to go talk to him? Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later. There are a lot of people worried about you. Where am I? In a hospital. Which hospital?  Did you take me back? Hey, Miles. Long time no see. Gary. When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it. Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week. My condolences. What are you pouring tonight? Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste? Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding. Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he? Oh, no! She died right in the hospital... Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves. That's the one. Oh, that's a sad story. Destroy all that which is evil... ...so that which is good may flourish He's done.  He's dying. Don't count on it.  We better take him out. Epps. Yeah. I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy. Thanks. This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know... Threatened to blow my brains out? Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple. Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier. This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior. Sulu! Standing by, Captain Kirk. You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain. I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up. Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination. The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency. I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked. Surely not. I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder... We belong in hell. And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that? What's this? The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them. Thorough man. What's his name, Letty? I didn't say... Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group. Saddle up, boys, that's our trash ! Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it? Take a look at these. I got Clawsen on hold-- --his dialing finger must be falling off-- --what do you think?-- --he went to her apartment and he told her-- I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware". We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love? Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that? Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals! Good luck. You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us. Everything okay? Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on? You didn't tell him about me? No. ... Where did curiosity get the cat? I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> -- And a very, very good one. Too good? Sir, that is true. Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo? Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him. Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson? Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all. Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix? Yes, sir. Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right. Yeah, can you say plagiarism? Not only that, he copied us! I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people. Yes, I guess you are. I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too. You better go get your things. I ain't got nothing but them books. You better go get 'em. All right then. He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors. Stay out of this...  Doctor? I want to go home. But could I just tell you this one thing? What? This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it. Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me. No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this. What? I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective. Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning. What else did he get? Wallet, cash, I.D... Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock. This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal. Queen Bavmorda transformed her. Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"? Chinatown street gang. Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman. -- The Nazi he knifed? Are you gonna start it up? Yeah. Why? Coz of something I lost. What's that? Compassion. What's compassion, mister. Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess. It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings. Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is? Mrs. Thorwald. There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word. M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y. Okay. Never argue with a man. Y -- what in hell starts with Y? Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry? Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud? Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry? But he's the head of InGen! You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else? Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse. He a Black man or an Indian? Both. Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him. We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail. Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off! -- It's not me! Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?! Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels. Thank you. I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag. At least let me give you this back. I washed it. Flood. No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease. It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in. Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild. I'm gonna get you, kid. Why in the hell didn't you help mama? I told her I would if she would give me time. I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house. You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof. That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up. I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain. I ought to break your damn neck. ... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up? I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table. Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here? Spit from your dad? I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt. Yeah. So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this. Y'think? I sure do. Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head. Oh, Jack... I'll bet! Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted. Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer. If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up. Good!  That's good! We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space. It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before. Are you sure? Not even with my father? How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat? What do you think? We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And the phone call to Rome... And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because... Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...? Hey, careful there! How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin. I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it. I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either. This isn't real? What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain. Ain't your fault. That's the way he is. Yeah. It's just like I figured. What d'you mean? Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'. Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow. Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham. Just for the day? Goin' to see my kid. I didn't know you had one. Yeah. Well, I do. Are you married? No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye. Where? Just... I have to. And I want to know where. Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you. Where are you going? Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag. The Albacore Club. It has to do with my father. I know. He owns it. You know? I saw him. You saw my fa... father? When? This morning. You didn't tell me. There hasn't been a lot of time. They're having a laugh... WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody! That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on! Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me. My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone. Megan? Yes. Is this David? Yeah? Megan where are you calling from? My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together. What are you talking about? We had him. I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war. This is terrible! Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here. Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street? Buy yourself that island in the sun? For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow. Right. I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right? Right. So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right? Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies? The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ. Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you? Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all. Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from? So where's the best place for mojitas? Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas... Where's that? Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there... The Keys? Havana. Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business... Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me. How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas. I saw him with you. We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen. Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent? Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears. Somebody has to do it. ... I was dreaming ... Something good? We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you. Must've been after we got engaged. Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother. So you had a nightmare. Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open. Were you there to catch me? No. How come? I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help. Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley? Shut up -- shut up -- I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall. I'd love to. I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon. Granted, Monsieur. Don't talk like that! I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this. Thanks for coming back for me. I love you. The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue? I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side. Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One... Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them. Talk to them!  Heavens! I beg your pardon? Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby. Let me see that. Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm. Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you? Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy? Aw, shucks, ma'am... Stop it. This is just sad. Swimming. Swimming is good. Does he know about what happened? Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven... 009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT! THERE'S THE COMET! You get him? Dead. Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime. Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration -- I'm sure I can come up with something. We've got nothing to talk about LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha... Uh-oh. You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth. My bill. No. Two champagne cocktails, please. Separate bedrooms? Yes. But you will not... be safe... Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about? In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream. What are you doing here? Let's go down to the basement. Mr. President-- He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--! Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him-- I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room! What is it?! I don't know.  Wave to them! Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office. Yes. Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad. So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that. I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus? Why? Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro -- Stop that talk now -- Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus? The fastest. Faster than cricket? Cricket's in the halfpenny place. So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there? You won't run. But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back -- -- I want to be Elvis. It's my idea. C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do. Okay.   You can be Elvis. Where's Michael? He's already gone to bed. It's not sucking, sir. Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else. We don't have anything else to try, Sir. Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up -- I... I don't know... What don't you know? This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think -- Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go? You'll be fighting with the octopus. Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream? This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater. Oh, for Christ's sake. Whattya mean? All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff. What stuff? Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control. Renata tells me you're going to rent a car. I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant. How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk. Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident. I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you? I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine. I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her. You're not envious? Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right? Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing. No. I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay? You knew. You just didn't care. He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me. Don't you mean what you do best? Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman. I think I'm dying . . . Don't . . . please! Please, don't! I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life... Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here. You and me have nothing in common. Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands? I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot? Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you. For me?  It's Shell Oil. I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself! -- That's the general idea. That's crazy! If you have a better idea - now's the time. What is it? Thank you for seeing me. That's perfectly all right. Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty! The hell you say! Wash is kin! Whoa, nine months? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I'll take the parasites. You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites -- I want brain parasites. Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia -- I want that. You can't have the whole brain! So far, you have four and I only have two! Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three. Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie. Certainly a new experience for me. Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever. Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle. And you've got one. It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are. So what's your angle? Sorry.  Trade secret. Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me. Well, what's wrong with it? It's...gone...! I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell? Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours. Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter? They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention... You sure you should be playing, Carl? What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape. What's this tiger shit? No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him. You think? I wasn't looking.. I was running. No. Huh? Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep. Aren't you giving an exam? I said, don't worry about it. Mother? But your mother -- No. My mother. Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind. What a great kite. I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about? I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible? Are you doing some kind of science project? Sort of. Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed. It's my lucky day. Hi. Want to buy a bed? Not much. It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot. You're some fucking jerk. Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it. In that place? Uh-huh. I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there. Back-up. Get rid of it. Why? It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat. I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater. Hello, young fellow! Coming to the pool for a swim? Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one. They changed Franklin's portrait. You think it's a conspiracy? Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin. If it's a boy --- Taylor. A bit much.    Lucas. Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson. Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy. No. They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die! Can't you take a guess? Well...not for another two hours. You can't take a guess for another two hours? No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago! You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream. Yeah...I guess. You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember... You're right. There you go.  Love you. Me too. Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back. Or what's left of him. Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves? He'll live. It's all right, Chet. It's not all right.  Come on, Dad I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer. Wait... So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean: ...ok... Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little... yeah. Matzoh!  Are you Jewish? I, actually yes. I love Jewish men. Why? <u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom? The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left... No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking... What evidence? For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally. It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control. I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General. This is Captain McGann. Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries - Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!! What's your problem Beavis? -- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency. Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises. I believe we've exceeded his expectations. I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher. It feels fine now, Jabez. Will you come into town with me tomorrow? I'd love to. Dr. Paulsen? Yes? Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it. Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this? Who's Baxter? He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>! Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days. It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved. Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money! I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh! Ghosts killed your father? Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house... And you think it's in there? Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me. Ready -- ? Oh, yeah. You askin' me to clear out now? You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha? Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ... Relax, John.  They were just kids. Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect. Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them. I think they'd understand. That's not the point!  They need me! The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface. Sabotage? A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air. Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags! There might be some extras in the garage. Did you feel that? Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years. Not that. Twenty large?  That's all? What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know? The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars. Might at least have left me my pants! Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and... I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast? Wow!  French toast, really? Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right? There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking. I understand. May I ask you something? Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par-- I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners. What's that? Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument. -- May I? It's so -- Please -- We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but -- Where's your shirt, Mueller? I used it to start the fire -- Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours? Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell. How bad will it be? Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble... Yes sir. So, you're really going to stay here? That boy wants me to. Did you knock on the door yet? Naw, I ain't. How long have you been standing here? Quite a spell, I reckon. Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch? I done et just a little bit ago. I mean tomorrow or the next day. I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow. Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon. What's funny? My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain. It is a pretty crucial subject. See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend. Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard... No... Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar? Hey, look-- No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did. Oh yeah? Prove it. Drive. I love this house.  I really love this house. You're okay. ...a <u>liaison</u> position... And what does <u>that</u> mean? ...I feel that... A liaison position with the Opera. Look at that guy. What a hunk. Check out the other guy's buns. What you sayin' boy? I think I recognize you. How? I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back. Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team? What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back? I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you! I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say. It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers start arguments. Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please. Just go ahead and tell us. There's nothing to tell. Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me? Come here, you little fool! Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him. Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about. --bullshit-- --she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil-- Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house. Here? More this way. Okay.  Give me the drill. That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there. It's time these boys saw some real blue water. Hello, Marty, when you come home? We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School. Mantan? Mantan!! I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead. Why's that? Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive. Except for the last part, that one's not bad. B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another. I don't like that one. Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him. But we accomplish the mission. Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division. Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material? No, sir. That's a mystery to me. Yeah, air. Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air. How you know?  It could be anything. I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look. Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it. Jah guides us. Maybe so... Am I... disturbing you? No.  Come in. I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important. What's the charge? Hello. How are you, honeybunch? Is Penelope in? The posies are for her? I wanted to apologize. You've come to the right man. I forgot my vacuum cleaner. I forget mine for years on end. Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper. Are you a fag? You're the faggot. Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit. Too bad. Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why? Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself. What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave. The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago. We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing. Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find. Damn, I wish this thing would go faster. Relax.  We're almost there. We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left! I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you? I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up. But the experiment was a failure. Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about. Go fuck yourself. We're scattering the fucking ashes! Walter-- JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! No, of course not... I never killed anyone... Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...? No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me? We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner... Yes, probably... maybe... So sometimes you were carrying just your sword? Yes, but... Did you use the sword that you held in your hand? No, I... I held it up to... You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this? Yes, maybe... I don't remember... ... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone? No, I... I never killed anyone! Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay? You betcha! Everything is double the price now, you do understand that? I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey. Beer yes, but no whiskey. You have no whiskey? No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul. 66. Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you? Where did you get that? That"!  This is not a "that"... Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Take some allergy medicine. You can't believe this bullshit. She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her. Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved! I don't care about the rest of the world! She's a nun, Vince. I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love? Subs are still at surface, sir. Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible -- Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods? I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me. Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh? How perfect. He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her. I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em. Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look. She's losing it! Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her! Jabez! Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in. Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf. You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment. Really? I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me? The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence... The Judgment is ours! Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography. Use your other hand!  Grab it! Help me!  I don't want to die! You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand! How's everything? Everything is everything. How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk. There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding. I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn. Boca? B.O.C.A. Doesn't register. Got a wife named Angie. No, nothing.  There's only some talk. What? Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well. Who brings it? Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It. Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific -- Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude. Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys? Worse. Much worse.  A teacher. What's all the panic about? The Dragon... You're still blaming me. No. I'm not. You wanted to come back to London. We came back. He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife. I think they missed their chance with her. She never left the apartment -- Then where is she -- in the ice box? -- until yesterday morning. What time? Six ayem. I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy. Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again? If you want to call it that. Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all. That's exactly what I am doing, again. Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me. I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break. Oh, for pity's sake... Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice. So all of our intel was bogus to begin with. Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll. By the light, by the light, Of the silvery moon, Of the silvery mooooon, I want to croon, He wants to croon, he wants to croon, To my honey I'll croon, He's gonna croon love's tune, Honeymoon, Honeymoon, honeymoon, Keep a shining in... Do you know what time it is? Uum... around ten? Becky? So I mailed your letter. Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle. M.F.E.O.? Made for each other. He's writing. Hello? If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic. You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you? I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology. Gonna cut me open? Well, let's wait for the X-rays. Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that. He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else. Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke. That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room. Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary. Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years! Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake. She hates me, Louis. You should go back to her. What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in. Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office. What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos. If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong. I can't relax. Wiggle your toes. How deep is he? A thousand feet. A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors. Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so. Then why am I here? What? What do you need me for? I came for Grace. You came to take my wife from me? Here come six more... grid two! Was this trip really necessary? I just can't seem to focus on anything these days. That's why it's good you came to visit me. How are you doing sweetheart? I'm good. Dating anyone? No, I'm working too much, I don't have time. What about the fellow in those pictures? What pictures? You know ...  ... whoops! Mother! Well, they were right out in plain view. Behind the books. But I was dusting. I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications. He seemed quite taken with you. I don't want to talk about it. You know, you never tell me anything. That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York. Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition-- I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and-- Would you cool it already? Police, help!  Po-- mmph. I've heard cars fuck with more harmony. Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass. Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack? What do you mean? You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant? No way... Would you? I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you. That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward. No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...? No. I never feel like that. I do. Where are you going? To the bathroom. Tom, this is our case. . . . What? This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go. Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again? I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu. O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back. That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom? I guess it depends on what you give up on. Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago. The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes. What'd she die of? She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*... Yes sir, I saw it. We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department. I am all attention. He requests your presence, once again, as part of... All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf. Don't worry the real men are in charge now. Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that. I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz. First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King. The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift. The fifth one this week"! Oh, for goodness' sake! And I thought you said it was something special... Nuke--  Good luck. You too...Meat. Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you. Fuck it.  Alright. I'm getting real tired of this maniac. Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic. Better call an ambulance first. I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah? You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like. Mr. Dennings? Well you know it's okay. Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday? You like him. Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this? Your not gonna marry him are you? Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not. What? Where'd you ever get an idea like that? But you like him. Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one. Do you not like him like daddy? Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do. Well I heard differently. Oh you did. What did you hear? I don't know, I just thought. Well your thinking's not so good. How do you know? Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really. Okay. You're my handsome man. I'm a bad person. No.  No. No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up.... You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble -- --- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you. What about that Rock Island bastard? It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse? How much do you owe? Let it go. Did they tell you to sleep with me? I told you, all bets are off. I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all. What the hell you talkin' bout? Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout. How do you know she did that? I was there, I saw her do it. Well, you weren't supposed to be there. I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this. Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it. Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it. He ain't killed. Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think. You first. Why don't you get off his case? Where have you been...? What's wrong?  What happened? Thea was attacked by a shark.... Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question? Yea, James. What are we going to do with... And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what? They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears. What happens if they don't do that? I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens. Great. So, do you think you made it into the class? I don't know, but I sure hope so. You could use the grade, huh? Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college? Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not. Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear. Huh? Gear. You know, clothing. Oh. Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this. You fight it cut. And up a dime. A mistake. Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...? It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead. How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart... Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons? I don't think that will be necessary. You're still beautiful... Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back? Alfredo died. Do you remember him? Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him. I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you. I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid. Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone. Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party. Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty. Carter, would I lie to you? That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge. Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level! You're not fooling anybody. Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother... When'd you get in? An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay? I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine. I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring. The ring... Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him - I don't know what's wrong with that kid. Maybe he's gay. Don't ever say that. What if he is? He isn't. But you know how to drive? Sure. Got a license?  But no car? Don't need it. I just got my license two weeks ago. You're good. I been drivin' since I was twelve. That would explain it. Can you help Mom? I'm trying. Got to. Is there much more of this torture? That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep. Oh, as long as we're here... You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start! Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool. I didn't do anything. Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you. Elaine! Ted! Elaine, what's going on? Ted, there's no time to explain. Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime... Actually, you may have. We'll just be a minute. Can I smoke? Wait here. No. I'm going with you. Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us. Blessed are the vegetarians. That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge. You may go, Smythe. Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me. Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay? If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel. Lynette, I told you already, it won't work. Then, I'll see you around. Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school -- I'm not going back to school. I need your help, Joyce. Where's Ich? Unavailable. Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible. Nathan! Are they all as -- small -- as that? Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case -- My time isn't up yet. Anybody know about this? I didn't even know about it. Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like? I think he's dead. No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head... Sorry Veronica. Betty Finn. Gosh..... Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator. Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure? Of course, but there's more -- Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now... With the compliments of Colet and Company! He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him. I came to see Rachel Lapp. Try the house. Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call. Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right? The best Burtless movie ever made. How's that? Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart. They're powering their forward weapons array. Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters. Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho-- Right. That's exactly what I meant. It tastes bad. But you can breathe it. Who were the ones you didn't write down from? Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again. Right.  No one else? Absolutely not. Why do you call him that? Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing. What do you mean? After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing. He requested this? He gets off on it. Sylvan can be talked into anything. Why do you say that? Like you said-she snowballed him. Sylvan? No; I snowballed him. Yeah, right. I'm serious... Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen. Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing. I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there. Hey. Where's Monkeybone? Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him. Back? You're sending me back? It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead. Death! Thank you! Thank me next time you see me. Mom? Yeah? You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what? Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud. Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you... Lisa works at the MGM Grand... I'm a "Dorothy". Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation? I don't notice anyone else complaining. Hello. What are you up to? All kinds of things. Making plans. Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future? I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me. You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person. Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too. It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us! Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank! No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign. He talks about women as if they were cattle. Every man to his taste, sir. Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true? Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time. Twenty! What did he do with them? That was something I was never able to find out, sir. Hey, baby. What's wrong? What's that outside, Daddy? Did you see somebody or did you hear them? I heard them. Where? In the backyard. Betrothed?  I think not. In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love. You wish you hadn't blown the whistle? There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it. Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you. Come again? You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers. Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock. This is a knock. Let the party begin. Have enough fun for the both of us. Oh, don't be such a victim. Yeah. And what do I do with him? Aaaahhhh, the portal! You bastard! Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means? Carpe Diem... seize the day. Very good, Mr._? Meeks. Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines? Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut-- -- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now? He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent. Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent? And again.  How would you get him on land? That's actually the easy part. But now... they are all one with the Borg. I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed. You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time. Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks. Ssh!  I can't hear Gino! We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on! I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality! What's the magician's weapon? The limitless power of... Anything. Strong. Canadian Club? You a mini-golfer? Nope. Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave. Can I get you something for the road? You have orange whips? Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya? No. I'm from Akron. So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father... Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck. That's not a question, is it? You're catching on. Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go. Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time. What the hell are you doing here?! I was with Jessie, she filled me in. Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in-- When we get this group down, I'm gone. You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something? I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it. Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you. Look, I know-- You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died. I did what I thought was right. Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it-- There wasn't time for anything else. We'll never know, will we? Look, it was a bad time for everybody. What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family. And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it! You mean with you and everything? `Bleed for your king. What's that? First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King. You're kidding. No... They don't kid. Morning. Good morning Mrs. MacNeil. How are you today? Fine thank you. That's good. Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns. May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' -- You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over. -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch. Well, I'll be--!!! What's the matter? He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair! He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that. What is it? Open up. What are you doing? I'm going in after him. You can't! I have to. Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in! Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not. What? I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too. Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive? Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales. Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it. Do you think it's a possibility? Yes. How can you say that? That wasn't the answer you wanted? Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort? Do you know what a wire transfer is? Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation. My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot. Sure. Just chisel some off your heart. So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife. -- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue. Do you still have it? No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you. That is not a human decision, not your or mine. What do you mean? It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on! There! You said it was boring. Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking! Bullseye! Stop the car!  Now!! What are you doing? Who am I? I don't know. That's right. He wants one. Dead or alive? Alive. Do you think you are a real master? Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind. Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight! Then tell me where Jade Fox is. On guard! Real sharpness comes without effort. Why? Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here. Have you thought about graduate school? No. Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work? You got me. Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass. You can t go! Jesus, Jack... Don t get on that plane! Jack. Please. Let s just go have a cup of coffee. That s all I m asking for. I m sure there s another flight to Paris tonight. What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay? No... no thank you notes. Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever. Lovely. I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler... You must learn magic. That's all I ever wanted! Then I will teach you. You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen. What is Tir Asleen? How much? I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten. You think it's that good? I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got. Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me? He's your son. Okay, boy, beat it. What's the matter? I didn't get her number. He was deaf when he wrote this. Who? Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow. Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house. I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it. But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke. Why do you say that? Haven't you seen the cabana boy? Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik. How's about it, Bart? Rather touchy, aren't they. I thought you knew this person. I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies. You're coming with me? I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition. I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl. Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass. You're kidding me. As Charlie Steinway is my witness. Peggy Lee? Tell her. Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary. The infirmary?... Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick? We're simply concerned about her...proximity to... Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague. Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child? Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star. That's great. I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One. Really? You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going. How many were there? Five.  Since I've been here. What happened to them? Dead.  All dead. How? Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off. If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it. It was one incident. Tell that to the families of the policemen who died. Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in? You do me too much honour, Sire. Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice. Where are they? Do you see them? Yes! Do you think they're cannibals? Get close to them. That place. By the window. It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday? I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car. So Signor Miles drove away and you did what? I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him? What'd you say, Captain? I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania. What's goosed? What is her disposition? Well, I guess he's found one. Joe, you do get around. I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in. That's what they get for not locking the door. So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath. You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up... So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am. Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand. Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man. Hell! What is it? I am. My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up. Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car? Can you just follow me? The back is full? Sure. Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity! Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights. Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet    thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before. I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty. Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel? I'll keep that in mind. Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night? Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . . Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment? In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . . May we go home now, please? The dog!?  You are named after the dog... Just let it go, I've got you! What're you nuts-- --it's less than four feet, just-- --shit!!! We're supposed to be asleep. Exactly. What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on? It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency? Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on. Why baseball? I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home... Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks for the information. Appreciate it. I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed... I know. Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer -- You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that... This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway? ... just saying you should think twice about it... ... I don't want to talk about it... What's his name? I don't know -- Campbell or something? I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course? Who knows? Fog, night... They'd never sail this close to the shore. Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow! In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone -- It was you, Juliet, it was you -- -- instead of what he is -- What I am. -- which is -- -- which is a hack. The man we know and love. A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet. Know and love? Yeah. I think you're lying. You're right. You see, they don't really know me. No, Alex, we don't really love you. You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet. We need a sympathetic face. I've always wanted to drive a crashed car. You could get your wish at any moment. No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else. Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash? The case could be made. No, it was lovely. Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name? Yesterday I read that Furtw ngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America. When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here. When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased? I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives. We could reach it on fire-mares. Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men. Hey, look at you. I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of -- My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends. Let us decide that. What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it? It's under control. Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave. I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please. Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change. This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first. What, what what are you doing here? Yes, that's right. Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street? What are they offering? Ten thousand dollars. That's so beautiful... I beg your pardon? You must be the new tenants. And you...are? He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot. So that gives you something. It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear. What about Neil? You don't like him, do you? What's to like? Tell it like it is. You asked. He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best. You could do better. I'll miss you, Mike... I thought about that. She must've fallen asleep at the table... Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling. I did too. Are you threatening me? I'm trying to get you to listen to reason. Can I give you a ride to your car...? ...Nah. I'm right across the street... ...Which one...? ...The red piece of shit over there... ...well, it suits you... ...get the hell outta here already... Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing. For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it. Yes, but... You are, aren't you? Certainly, but... Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother? They'll know who I am. We'll change your appearance. How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you? Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you. Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have? Umm, he's going to make it isn't he? Maybe. Come on back up here! Nope. Give me back my hat! Double nope! Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job? Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on? You think that's a lot of money? All I have in the world. That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man. Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210. No... I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway? Taken. Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them. Everyone who plays the game knows the rules. That's exactly what I told myself. It smelled of the fire. It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way. Really? Tell me about it. It's an uprising. Of birds? Certainly, of birds. I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know. Thanks for reminding me. I guess we get what we pay for, huh? Are these your bags? Yes.  And that one, too. Okay, doll. I suppose you want a tip? Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization. Bye. Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight? Why? Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull - Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny? Wanna see my driver's license? Get lost, will you? That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate. Erin. It's not your fault. It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead. No. You don't. Yes I do, I really do. My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon -- Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here. I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had. Why? Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly! Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible. Well ... yes. All right. But - Ah, come on now! You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself? Not even a hunch. Just hope. With a little checking, I could get to believe you. I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper... Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that -- I understand, Dick. Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing? Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so -- I understand, but Annie, please... - See, what you can do for him --... Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same. ... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is -- It isn't right to make him suffer... And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please. Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything. Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door! We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers. Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality. Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read? Of course I can. I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines? I'll have a bash. Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama? Ta. Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian. How about it, Ma? I'm ready. You have the cutest nose I've  Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me! What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat? It isn't cheap. It's nice. Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now  Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live  Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose. Good night, David. Good night, Alex. All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go. May I get you some -- That'll be all. God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me... They tried... but I didn't let them. I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane. That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to. Your father?? He's at a home out here. You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore. If we get him, I'll be happy enough. No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys. How can you say that?  Especially after today? Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here. You're the oldest man I know, Somerset. You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won? You do your job... Where's the victory? You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there. Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man. Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already. Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole. Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob. There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you. Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem. What do you want? What are my choices? Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol. No alcohol? No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want? What do you think I should get? Non-alcoholic malt beverage? ...Noooo. Orange soda? No. Coffee? No. Sparkling apple cider? No. Water? Water? One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you. Water. B.B. It's me   Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year? I didn't see you. What do you mean? You haven't heard? Andy's dead. Dad, please... What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing! This ain't the time, Richard. Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks. Keep your voice down. Or what? Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing Climb off me, will you! And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes. Taylor.	I'm telling you -- Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste? Welt...it depends, why? Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it. Anyone there? No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up. Baby, don't talk that way, baby... You are so money, and you don't even know it... That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know... You like this shit? It grows on you. You know what they make this stuff out of? Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it. I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all. Where'd the road go? That's it. That's the end. And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded? Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place. Dad? You call this archaeology? Get out of there, Dad! Oh my God. Pardon? Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no. What's wrong? Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect -- What? I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that. Like what? What do you think? Well I don't know. For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours. So? Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me. So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters. And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece. And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman. Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me? Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica. Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so... Kay-em you okay? I am now. I missed you, Thorgan. I missed you too. I love you. Another summer of working at Swenson's. Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open. You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex. What do you want? I want romance. Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV. Tell me again how it started. Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face... Do you remember what triggered it all? The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did. You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson! I try... Where is my father? Where is the emperor and the army, soldier? Hello? I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny? They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies! You're sure... Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message. Okay, Ken. We're going. Oh my God...What did he look like, the man? I can't remember.. Your father doesn't like me, does he? It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long. Thank you for accepting. Thank you for inviting. I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy. You are. And I'll come again. Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre? Yes, Sire. Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true? Who told you this, Majesty? It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true? Well, yes, I admit it is. Would you tell me why? Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy. What we got here a crusader? Sounds like it. That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything. We'll be back before you are, old man. May the Force be with you. Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours? Home, school, here... Can we get this car there? Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator. A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite. Who wards off demons. Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow -- Reliquary -- A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy. That little Maharajah think he big stuff. You don't like him do you? Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes? No. Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice! Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving! Willie! How'd <u>you</u> get in there? Stu... It's a <u>party</u>. Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you - What? You ever just stand still for a minute? You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that? Get out. If you'll just let me - We need to keep moving. Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the... Billy, I can't talk to you now. Don't worry, Mom. I know. Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors. What's your first move? A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days. Hello, I'm here about the ad. Please, have a seat. Cardiff Giant.' That's us. You sure? Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service. It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives. However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right? Five minutes to Cloud boundary! I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there... It's still an electric shock! Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration... That little black line? That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old. You are fortunate in your father. Thea is an orphan. You're crazy. Get your clothes on, move your butt. So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville -- You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis -- C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now. It smells funny. Like gasoline. Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico. My dress'll reek. Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth. Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years. I will, and you remind me of the same thing. Yeah. Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly. Jeff, call the FBI right away... They do this with impunity! Jeff... They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it. Okay.  Come on, come on! Mother, father, sister. Sister older or younger? Younger. Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work. Punks", huh? Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area. Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand. No, I meant this. It's hard to go places, isn't it? There's been an accident, Truman. Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling. So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty? I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house. Sorry, didn't mean to -- That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why. First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire. Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you? I can't go out.  Not like this. I think you look beautiful. Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides... I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia. Well, what do you know about that! Found in Asia! Uh-huh. When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it. Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it? Not at all. What? I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside! Why show me? I'm going to run. Why tell me? You know something. About running, dying what? Both... running's what I'm interested in. I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has. It's different now. Help me. How can I? The preacher said it absolved us. For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar. Daughter -- my daughter -- She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew. A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush. Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen. They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all. Yeah, well, that's enough. Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um... Ashes To Ashes? That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen. So, it is a blacklist. Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball? Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair! Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror. Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ. Creepy guy. The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9. Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up. What am I supposed to do? Nothing. You just do nothing. I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge. She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper. What could have done this? Be careful. Of course, I'll be careful. But where are you going? Down to the incinerator. Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes! She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy. You were convicted of the crime. That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did. You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged. No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind. You haven't been drinking, have you? No. Just O.J. Why did you do that? To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything... No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him. Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me. There it is, Sal.  Sal? I'm here. Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board. What do we do? Wait. What if they get in here? They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't. I heard you. Feel okay? Yeah. Shaky? Nope. Chills? Huh uh. It's time to go home now. No.  Please. Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up. WHAT did you say? I said welcome. WELCOME? Well, of course. We always welcome friends. Who was that French guy, anyway. Oh, just some insurance guy. ...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins. Ever meet her, or they talk about her? Not yet. Who's the other one? White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's. What's her story? It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell. And splittin' with her? I'm sure that was the idea. What did you say? I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont. She told you that? Uh-huh. Was she there? She didn't say. But she mentioned Beaumont by name? Uh-huh. Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow? Right. Everything's the same, except one change... Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby? You could give me my gun back. Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days. Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef. What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house -- This is my daddy's house -- This is my house too! And this is my room so get out! Yes. Please don't say this. Mank- Don't whisper it. Don't even think it How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--! Orson. Stop. Just stop Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you. Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions? I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher. That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class. LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller? She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened. Sit down, I have something to tell you. I'm fine. Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years. Close enough to walk to! Martin, would you run me an atmospheric? I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two. We take the Avedon, right?  Simple. He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father. Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it? Maybe less... Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo. Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night. You must leave.  You were not here this morning. But I didn't do this! The police will not know that. They will want to investigate. We have his note. Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone. But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool? You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back. Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it. Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator. Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking. Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this? Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page. Where's the Majority Leader? The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches. Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery? Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you? Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people. Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo-- Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny? All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff. Thanks very much, sonny-- I'll take your hat into the cloak room. Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button. Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up. No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day. Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning? Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot. Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced. I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different. Your Spidey senses tingling. Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about? You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics. How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point. You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit. I always favored the Hulk. Hulk was dumb as shit. Aw, fuck. What. Very noble.  Not smart, but noble. You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life. Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy. What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ... Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything. I don't understand. Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster. Ah, so I pull the strings! Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good! What? I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect. Boy, don't you hate it when that happens? She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him. When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally. So I heard. Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen? Just myself. That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think? Where you going? For a ride. With him? Yeah. Dolores, wait! Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life. Did you really mean those things you said..? Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means? Carpe Diem... seize the day. Very good, Mr._? Meeks. Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines? The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless.. Is there any danger? Some kind of virus? We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect. Nothing scary there.  Sorry. Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo... Spock, I thought I was going to die. Not possible. You were never alone. We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own. Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws. We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. Admittance form is wrong. Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... ...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water... They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? No. Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up. Right. Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan. Right. Brindisi versus Electric Boat. You got a good memory, Franky. I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport... Huh.. .Hello? All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point. Ted, what are you talking about?! Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on. Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna? Ha!  You tell me. Kate... Jack...God, it s been so long...You look... xxxxxx... xxxxxx The money, the gear! That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses. OK, don't panic; let's think about this. Forget her. She still loves me. She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this. She's my destiny. Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride. You'll see. Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his. Oh, thank you, sir! I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die? Me? No, that door over there. I don't want to die. Are you afraid? Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man. Exactly. Woah. Death. The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini? No. Bob did. Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes. Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry? Anthony, I'm petrified. If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost. What would you do, Holiness? Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here. Is it safe? Absolutely. It's his life insurance money, you know. I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he? I guess. One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs. So? So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace! A lot of people think like that. Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two. Go, Sulu. Is he afraid of the water? No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now. You're so easy. Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all. Yeah, what for? Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all. You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to - Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help! Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy? It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere? Jesus, man... Please... Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile? Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours? Do you know the... soccer stadium? Did you build the Estadio Olympico? No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style? Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there. What am I?  The fall guy? I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it? ...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing. I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine-- What're you, a fucking marriage counselor? Yoooooow. Don't look down! Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other. How'm I doing so far? So far you're great.  You got a cigarette? Uh ... uh ... ooooooops? Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak? Scared.  Can't talk. That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here? Yes. I was just taking her in some tea. O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out. Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close. Yes, but you, you do care about me. Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street! Did you look in here? No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something. Well, let's broaden our outlook. I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone! Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory... Myself and Mr. Pink? You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds? When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco. It's insane. Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day... If it worked. If it worked, yes. What happened? Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive. CONTINUED We're trying to get there. I hope we can. Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off -- Johnny. Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking. Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers? Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh... Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari... Uhhh.. ahahaha... Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem? Uhhhmm... It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there... 212-555-4240. GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN. Son, don't -- BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY -- -- no. GIVE US YOUR MONEY. Put the gun down, please, boy. GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID. Son, please, now.... DAD -- Please, boy, put it down and it's ok. Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular. They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither. I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you. You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        + Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        + You got him wrong. Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either. Repeat that, Bill. Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell. Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be? I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before. Where is he now? He's in the infirmary, being examined. Did you ask him who he is? He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway. If he's not Madison, then where's Madison? I've got men searching the building and the grounds now. Count it. Huh? Count it. Jack... Count the fucking money, Frank. Yes, Hannah? I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage. Flynn...  Where's Ram? I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it. Your lady friend did. The lady s not a friend. She s a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies. It's a good thing you pay me well. Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a-- No.  He checked out okay-- How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this? I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching. No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington. Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here! Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington? What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things. That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am. We'll come back in the morning. What is that he's working on? An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream. It is kind of rough. He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake. Look, the ice is melting. Yes. You promised me a drink.... Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it.... The kind with an umbrella in it.... Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life.... What was that about? Get me Wigand. Sure. ...fuck is this? Fuck! I enjoy his company.... I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him.... He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous.... Sorry, "dude". What's the deal? Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out? Why you dogging me up? They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor. I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away. All of us. Where are you staying while you're here? A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet. And how long are you here for? As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family? My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer. Oh. How old? About a year and a half. No, your kids. Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16. Must be nice having kids. Forget it. I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date? I'm concentrating on my career right now. Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?! Anita! Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy   If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye. Not in that way; you're always looking for company. Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous. The Rembrandt--that was quite good. It was perfect. Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead. I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on. That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke. Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo. Can I put these here for tonight? In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think? I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well. Yeah. Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it. I was just about to have my dinner. If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck. No wallet, huh? No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil? What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right? Come on man. Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend. On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished. You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit? Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that... This guy is gonna run to the FBI. Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal. I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it. Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself... Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody. Now you will read this into the tape recorder. I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming. And so do I! So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve. Yes, Mister Harding? Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday? No. Mister Harding, that is not true. That's a better one. Yes. He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole! Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather. Can you see it? No. What does that mean? Did he ever get rough with you? Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him. Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh? No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud. Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want. You bet I do, sir. But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome. Well, not too, I mean, a little. A mule is an animal with long funny ears. He kicks up at anything he hears. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. My fault. You're not hurt, are you? I don't think so. I wish you'd make sure. Why? Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars. Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. Thank you. Who are you? Now, really - Time is money, George. We need extra beer today. Business is good at the hotel? Very good. I am always glad to see you Paul. What was that about? I know, right? So how can I help you...? I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen! Do you wanna tour the clubs? No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...! Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid? He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain. Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system? Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim? Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes. If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby? Not exactly. They were vampires, weren't they? Yeah. God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires. I don't understand. Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this. No, you didn't.  When? Didn't you get my message? You broke up with my machine? You weren't home.  Like always. You left me a message? I'm out of here.  Jenny. Funny couple, ain't they? Yeah. If you ask me, I don't believe they're married. They're married all right. I just seen the license. They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this. Yeah? What do you reckon that's for? Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet. A trumpet? Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it. But what in the world do they want a trumpet for? I dunno. James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it. Thank you. It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez. And to history. Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest. You serious? All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up. But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script. Hmm. Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh... Yeah. ...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I-- What -- am I -- Cured, yes. We can't just... Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back. The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us. Just the two of you?  What about the crew? Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records - That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him. Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her. I see. I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur. I wonder if it runs in the family. The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success. What's the point? Not to be trapped. You underestimate the trap, Mary. What happened to your face? Got in a little accident. Yeah. All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job. Thank you. Your country and a lot of innocent people in it... ...owe you. Us.  Owe us. What's going on?  What are you doing? Thinking. About what? I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus? Why? Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro -- Stop that talk now -- Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus? The fastest. Faster than cricket? Cricket's in the halfpenny place. So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there? You won't run. But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back -- Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it? Give it back. Try and take it. I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out. Why? It bugs me. You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out? Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around. How should I know? Murray. Thanks. You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work. You ain't seen nothing yet. Yeah. A glorified doormat. Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it. I call that a perfect day. A perfect night. Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug. Hm.  We should do it again. Just every once in a blue moon, you know. Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper? Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors? Not as a rule. They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns! Tie it off!! Outer. ... Well, you wanted to see it. This is it? Around here. Yes, I am. Uh-uh. That's a spook house. Just watch. Did you tell them that I flooded the school? I didn't say shit. That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it. Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about. You know what? I think that you did it. ...You don't? Nah, that's all forgotten. ...It is? Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back. Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he -- But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives! But, Buzz -- Say, that was a swell idea! But, Buzz, you know I never -- And Sid says you stole it! But Buzz -- Lyssa. Where are they keeping you? In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening. I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged. We're in trouble! Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens. No, no, no! She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee. Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff. Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around. I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam. Neither will I. Don't do that. Do what? Sneak up behind me like that. What's your fucking problem? Why's it always my fucking problem? Did you have a pleasant trip? Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad. What do you mean? Well, I assume you let him kiss you? Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses. I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further? A little. How much further? Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS! I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to. Not much further. You never went, uh, all the way? Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium? Could be. What the hell do you want? I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why? Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest. And you admire that? It's the only way to play. But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct. You believe? Yes. You feel? Yes. You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day. Tom, are you okay? You try. You try talking to her. Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on? I give up. I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms. Could we step outside? Your shot. You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man? That's what the game's all about. Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket. What the hell is that? Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't. Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile... You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest. Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat. You got a back door to this place? No.  What's wrong with the front? Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything? No. All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there. What the hell for? Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake. He wants to apologise. He should do it in person ...I mean ex person. Yeah...I have to get away. I know a nice island. How did you know we'd come here? It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous. Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote. I hope so... This is...this is...a very special moment... Awww, he's so cute. What's his name? Lenin's Tomb. All your soldiers speak Latin? No, just one. It'd cost you. Of course.  How much? Five full nights... days too? Where are they taking him? To be hanged. Nigel, get lost. I have to talk to you. You're wasting your breath. You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft. I could teach you a thing or two now. This will be a different kind of device. That damn thing. You know how it made me look...? I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer. I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen. It will. No, not at all. Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing. I'm... I'm alright. How was your date? It wasn't a date. He's just a friend. We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know... This weekend? You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now! Seems like the whole world's gotten younger. You alright? Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later. See you in hell, Snake. If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me. Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia? No. What happened? That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend. You're here quite a bit, then. I live right around the corner. You moved? I been here a couple years. Very nice. What is it? Mary Had A Little Lamb. Ah. A classic... Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance. Not exactly. I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni. He said you lost something. Yeah, come on in. BRANDON!	TIME TO GO! Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit. Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black. Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column. Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right? What did . . . His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird. -- You found his mugshot? That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you? Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but -- No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there? Call me. Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you. You think I should hang around more with the crew? Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka? Why would we be involved with these people? Good question. Please. Please don't walk away. I just can't look at you the same way. What?  What is it? It's very hard for me to come and tell you this. Am I disturbing you? I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all. Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself. Well, I can tell you some stories   ...That's what's important. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, what then? It's simple, you just go to the bathroom. Is he not going?  I booked a flight. He's not going tonight. I told his father he'd be on that flight. Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight. Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy. And you're not the wife. It's not a contest. Damn straight. One minute. I think this is about where we came in. This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... You're beautiful. So are you! I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time. This would be a bad time for me to leave. We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water. It does look good. Scottie! How does it work? Can't you see? Oh, yeah. There. I'll play you. What? One game.  One-on-one. For what? Your heart. I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places. Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ. The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now. When do they go to press? Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you. How do I know their voices are -- Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know. That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge. You may go, Smythe. I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies. You're coming with me? Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving! Papa! Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden. No one calls you that. She does. She says I sleep all day. I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him. What's wrong, Mary? Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before. They may have been friends of hers. Mr. Scott on discrete. Scotty, let's have it. I won! What a big boy.  How old are you? I believe I'm rather late. Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface. Close your eyes. What? I'd like you to close your eyes. Why? To relax. I'm relaxed. Close your eyes and let your mind be blank. Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me? I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong. Timmy Baterman. That was wrong. Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard. She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to. Lucky girl. Captain... He was just about to explain the whole damn - We gonna jump or jerk off? My man! Come in, 007. You know the Minister? Of course.  Minister Johnstone. Mr. Gillis, if you please. Right with you. ... What's the matter? Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself? You're back. It's Monday morning. It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone. You're blaming me? I had to go see my family. I'm your family. Basquiat, what did you take? I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you. His hair... any color. Don't you want to know where I'm going? No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask. I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning. Leave now. Oh, grow up. Why should I? Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back. If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me. Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it. What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love? I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street. I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you. Well, what's your idea of love? Chains? No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real. But she still might call! Are you coming or not? I'll drive. Not a chance! What's the word on the chairs? I'm working on it. Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge. I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff. No, Andy. Don't know the kid. Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble. Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt? You --  -- are in for a surprise. Am I? Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings... Did you do any of that? No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine. You think I'm up for it? You learned from the best. I like it better when I'm on top. Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done. I'm sorry. I've been kidnapped by the village idiot. Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot? How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess! What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...? Like pick up some booze and go to a motel? Or we could do that yeah. Read it. Here? The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician. So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything? Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta. Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split. You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo. The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers. Can I ask you something personal? I'd rather you didn't. Do you have a girlfriend? Not while I'm in training. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Do You? No. Not at the present. Getting ready to invade. So where's Plissken? Weapons storage... It's perfectly safe. I promise. ... Maintenance facility... Not supposed to talk about it. You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that? Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot? Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours. Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us. It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there. Interesting presentation. Interesting video tape. They point, I shoot. Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet. Of course. You are responsible...What has happened? We're not sure... No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me. She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate... She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call! I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station. You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful. Really? Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable. So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you? No one would miss me. I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne. Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis? You guys are so sweet! This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food. But we can't just sit here -- ! Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two. When you get up to a hundred, wake me up. What's wrong with it? How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do. Yeah, she looks all right from here. Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress. I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute. Yeah. My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said. She's alright, isn't she? Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today. Why not? She got married last month. Married? Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans. Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important. I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow. It can't wait until tomorrow... Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies. Slayers! We must enter the swamp. I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it. Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name. You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam! Yes? Do you have something against science? Not if it works. And what in your estimation works? The umbrella. Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad. Is your bad? Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet. Yeah. He's a vampire alright. Help me get him to the boat. Leave him. How's Mama and the kids? Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor. My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour. Just sandwiches... Right. But you -- died -- Deacon brought me back. Fight him -- ... Where did curiosity get the cat? I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> -- And a very, very good one. Too good? You like shoes? No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight. It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it. I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine? No... no. Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man? In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn. You bust outa jail, Tom? Naw. They paroled me. Oh. Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens... But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it. I don't know. Who's Elizabeth? Bring me something simple. I never think about food. But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about? The future of the common people. That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch   la P re Mathieu. I want to stop aging. And I want Doucet. Rennie...what'd they do to you?? Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean. You take care. If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here. It's not what I was expecting. What did you think it would be? I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam. I don't recognize that constellation. Dell, plot our location. So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself? Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one. I'm so glad you're here. I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before... It's okay. I understand. How is she? She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her. Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy. You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you? I remember him. Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do? I am butcher. You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for? You stuff sausage in it. And what do you do with the bones? Dog food. They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here. Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay? Please, Nancy. Trust us. I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done. This is how we've managed to last. We're able to surprise each other. In and out of bed. Because we're completely mismatched. We don't even like each other, do we? I'd like you to meet my father. Oh--won't YOU come in? Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly. Thanks, handyman. I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something. The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...! Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve! Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado? Yes, I do. Do you see him here in the courtroom? Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table. Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado. Here you go.  One champagne cocktail. Thank-Q! I thought only hookers drank those things. Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em! Who? The... They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building. Is that true? How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point? ...going to War... It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>... I never won an Oscar. N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars... Yes.  Indeed I did. You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall... And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell... Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any... Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant ...that's what it is. The Country Is At War. It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. ...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania? Because. They got to have something that we want. I'm sure they do. What do we have that they want? Freedom. Why would they want that? Tony. Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here? No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school. I want you to look at this. What is it? It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage. What's Hinckley Cold Storage? I heard. Good police work. Just horseshit luck. Don't ever forget how good you are. When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it? No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon. If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it. I will. You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me? Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. I got your message. Way to go! Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom. LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED What you say? LET THY SOUL BE HEALED -- Burn them. And old ladies? -- Burn them. And the world -- the whole world. -- Burn it all. And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend? That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do. This is filed incorrectly! Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle! A year is a long time. Not so long--just once around the sun. Tommy...! I'm all right. Say it again. I'd do anything for you, Dil. Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers? They're good! And if she runs? Take care of it. What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer? More history, Rose. Are you going to get your degree soon? Well, I am working on my thesis. It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff. Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola? You're so sweet. It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess. Tell me all about her. She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early. How early? Very early. Dawn. Of which morning? The following morning. Sunday. No one met her? No. Or arrived with her. No. She didn't call anyone? Even locally? No. You didn't spend the whole night with her did you? No! Of all... How do you know she didn't make a call? She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way. Back where? What do you mean? You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather... Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave. How did she pay you? What? Cash or check? For the cabin... Cash. And when she left, she never came back. Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind... I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling. I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go... She isn't still here, is she? Not at all! Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant? Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on. ...he wants to testify...? It looks that way. You know what that would mean? To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify? ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that. Women are all you have on your mind! She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing. So you were looking for a new challenge. Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime? Is it bad? No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus? I didn't. Some kinds of women are... -- so when are you going to Egypt? You mean when are you going to Egypt? And you? I just work for the travel firm. Talia, don't go! Wha-at?  What is it? Everything. That...fucking...bitch! It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say-- Package away in five..four..three.. two..one... I'm not ready! Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu? Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat. What is it, a sore throat or what? Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious. The doctor? Was the doctor here? Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about. Is she running a temperature? What is it? Just a teensie one    ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right. Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me. Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak. Well, look who's here... Good evening, Mrs. Cook. Just who is here, can you tell me? Could I see Sofie, please? No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling. See?  You re upsetting my customers. What do you want? How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons? What?  This is not possible. What is it? Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone. Are you alright, Wade? Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay. Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral. Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town. Always has been. This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things. Who? Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him. Who? You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with? The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running... Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn. That's what I want -- a gaff rig. Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner. You wouldn't believe me. Try me. Oh, you -- And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER. Hi Loretta. Hi. This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro. Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through? Which nostril am I breathing through? Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest. Sssssh. Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her? No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E. Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it. The back-up does the same thing. Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal? Hi. I thought you wasn't comin'. The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu... That's all he said. Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors... Her doctors killed her. I'm sorry...? Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her. Do you know who her doctors were? I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were. The most respected... Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill? Come on. Where? You want to go ballistic? I don't know. I don't like being out of control. Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend? Because she is my friend. Is this where no one stays? Yeah, that's right, that's it. What is this? Security. From what? Jehovah's Witnesses? There was a break-in. Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six. Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him. Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad. The vortex is collapsing, sir. Contact Starfleet Command. You what? I want to be the way I was before. Good. I'll show you how, apey. That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though. Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne. Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards. What's he holding? You want me to stick around, I could -- You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call. Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins. How do you do. No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it. Well now, I don't believe assa property scription. Well, that's how I characterize it. Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation. Pullin' ah pants down... Wipin' little circles with his bread... Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em! The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'. Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...! Fire, Mr. Scott! In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him. Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take? That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should. Hey, we were saving that! For today, I guarantee it. And who in God's name do you think you are....? John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant. What are you doing? Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him. He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome. Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock. Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls. My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko. Wacko? That a technical term? Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you? So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right? Exactly. You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead. When did I leave? You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two. Not bad for government work.  Having a good time. Haven't had so much fun since Live TV. Aye, sir. Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant. Kronos, sir? I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant. Aye, sir. Okay.  What'd you spot...? Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull? I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game. I can't believe you're a Laker Girl! You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here? Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects. She wants me to talk to you, Heather. Who <u>is</u> this?? Your mother's pastor. What happened to my Dad?? There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal. Yes. I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral. No. Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you. Our" Crow...? Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet. The night is young. I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on? Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary. ...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey? She's dead, Barton! If that was her name. Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know. Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement. And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something... Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer. Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man. I hope you find him. I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all. My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway. May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring. Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate. It truly is. This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior. Sulu! Standing by, Captain Kirk. You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain. I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up. Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination. The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency. I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked. Surely not. I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder... Yes sir. I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was   well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou? A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law. As I told you about English policemen. Well taken, Concorde! Thank you, sir, most kind ... And another! I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me. So what?  Let's make'em wait. I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff. C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times. Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly. What do I do? Finish him, finish him. Your way. Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way? Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey. I know about the bachelor party. You are false data. Huh? Therefore, I shall ignore you. Hello, bomb. False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you. Hey, bomb. The only thing which exists is myself. Bomb?  Not yet...   ...but it s getting there.   Are you guys all right? You could've killed us. It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him. No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck. We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out. I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open! I think he's ready. Oh boy! I object, your Honor... Overruled... Exception! Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed... Cheery looking bunch. Better living through electricity. I'd be gentle as a lizard -- I'd be clever as a gizzard -- Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers. The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard. Mike, take it easy... Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming. It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case. It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her! Did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said?!! Was her breakfast conversation that bad? Shut up. I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch. What was it? This looks familiar... Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful. Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you. Our" Crow...? Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet. The night is young. Amazing how? She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted! Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body. Just what the hell is he talking about? We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709. Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen. 500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that. Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here? It ain't your locker no more. Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more? Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there. It was stolen! Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels. I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations. This is insane.  You've got no proof. Why not? Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time. What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you -- Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma? I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch! Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good! It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door. Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time. What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you. What do you want to know? If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have? He's engaged the override. Can you shut it down? Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why? If you want to tell me. Perfect.  Sandbag the father. And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this -- Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you. Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G? Yes, ma'am. Where were you? On his six. Make it snappy, Colonel. There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there. Don't give this to anybody else, will you? It's all yours. Thanks. What's the matter? How can you ask me that? You're making me feel guilty again. You are guilty. I'm guilty. Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta. I know what I know. And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again? He didn't come! I'm here! You're late! We're here. We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents? Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff. Definitely! I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day. Claudette... Somebody'll see. No, they won't... Goodbye, Kundun. No! She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there! That bitch called me a bitch. I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now. No... no, please... you cannot... And don't pass on the right. Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one... Hey, man, why'd you say that?! Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya! I want them spitting blood! Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy! What shall we do? Tea would be nice. What happened to you? I had a dream that Grandma died. Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are. She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right? Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter. I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize. That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning. I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them. Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but... Fine.  That's great. Is that it? Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time. Sure, but is that it for the list? That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again? Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there -- Nice friend. Yeah. What's his name? Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl. Music for Old People." What does that mean? Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City. ...I can't hold onto this anymore... I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill -- ...gimme that fuckin' phone... Who are you gonna call? I wanna see this...where is he, do you know? Who? Jack. Is Jack your son? Not really to live, just to play. That building? Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them? Should I? Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?! How the fuck should I know!! Will independent sources corroborate that? Hello? Yeah... ... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory- I just can't believe it. It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity- I can't believe Eve said those things! Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired... I don't understand. Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture... Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it? Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business... What? Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late. Do you mind if I call you Letitia? Letty. First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are? I answered these questions last night. I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night. What? It doesn't matter. No. I want to know. ... Sex. Ah. Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command. That's right, sir. We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we? You're right, sir. No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls. I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so. No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major. Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now? Who do you think you're talking to? To you, sir.  But how do I know? Are you trying to be insubordinate? No, sir. I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing. Plan-R???? Are you hard of hearing, Major? No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing. As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details. General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter. Are you questioning my orders, Major? No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir. You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention. Thank you, sir. Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs. Yes, sir. And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners. MERRIN!!!!!!! Are you tired? How do I look? You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are. Have another drink, Thelma. This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life! Yeah, but, buddy -- Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh... You can fuck off, too. You're taking a big chance. I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway. Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job? Yes, Sir. As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about? Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with. I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her .. I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand. You'd be surprised. Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed. Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus. My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil. I know the name. Why? Old friend of your father's. You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann. H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you-- You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders. I resign. You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign. Watch me. You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. What are you talking about? Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team. Will you please tell me what you're raving about! You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York. You must have me confused with  Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley. Are you listening to me, Lennon? You're a swine, isn't he George? I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on! Okay. great! On screen... We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative... Mookie. What? How come you ain't got no brothers up? Ask Sal. Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here? Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel. Peter's brother?  But -- Half-brother to be precise. Cool it. We got business. Yeah, dickhead. Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms. If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day. Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked. I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer. Okay, what happened? He's going to be all right, right? No. He's dead. No way, man. He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it. You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking... No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right. How are you feeling about work? Let's not talk about that now. So she had you in jail, in Russia? Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad. What did you say to me? It's a little late for you to be up. Look answer my question! And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf. Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!! Don't hurt me. We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are. You sure you want to know this? Yes. Okay. Listen -- all I really want is an estimate. It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you? Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains? I've been in prison, remember? The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho. Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one... Ready? Hit it. I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events. Yes. I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times... What's wrong? I'll never be able to do that. Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ... No, that's not it. I tried that already. Did you try going through C-Gate? Yeah. Of course. And, Corporal...  ... be careful. Yes...  ... father. Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy. You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you. Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her. He loved her. Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear. Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve. That's what gives me The Fear. Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear. Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me? Not much. Why? I have to go. GO? Yes. Leave the country. Tonight. Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours. No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody! OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left. Can we make it? That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door. I want to leave fast. OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. Do they pay you to screw that bear? Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves. We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya. Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy. Happy. He said "happy? Actually he said "glad." _ 85. Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too. God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker. Somebody has to help you lazy bastards. ...thanks Natalie. ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on. I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes. Why? The guys is ready to deal now. Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner. Now that's down-right insulting. I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules. Jack. David. You're not having a good time are you? Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place? This is Barry. What are you doing? Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working. Are you going to the party tonight? Yes I am. What are you doing? Nothing. Right now, you're doing nothing? I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing. What time are you gonna be there? Seven o'clock. You can't be late. I won't. I'm serious. I know. Seriously. Ok. You can't be late though. I know. You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go. I know. Seriously. I know. You can't just stay in your house. I know. Yeah but I'm serious. Ok. I'll see you there. I'll see you there. Don't puss out. I won't. I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl. I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks. Lana Lang. How great to see you. Clark. Or a vampire. Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something? You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy. My dinner. I was wondering where you got that glow of good health. Want one? Uh... got any cinnamon? I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy? Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy. Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or... Hmm, so you're in the picture business? You could say that -- <u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money. Raising money is tough. Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve... Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line. We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around. Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman. Ever shot anyone? Yes. Does it make you... hard? ... Hard? Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man. Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system. You don't have the authority to do that. Do we need him? The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around... How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>? Switch hands. What? I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out. The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing.... Feathers all over the place.... It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them. That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here? Yes. I was just taking her in some tea. GO! Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind. Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place? Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him. You broke my arm! There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move! Forget Tonya Randall. I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me. Then prove her wrong. I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me. So you're gonna act salty all night? Hy-Brasil? Is THIS Hy-Brasil? I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week. ...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me. Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June. You could have a great beach house for that. Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration. Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here. Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray. I gather you're a decorator. You got it, a great spender of other people's money. Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place. Where is it? Upper West Side. Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant. Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo. This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured... No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore. Please  - I can't explain things like this to your right ear. Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear. Who the devil is he? A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table    the one at the feet of Dante. ...Hello. Garland, it's me. Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been? I... He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now: You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody... So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about. What do you mean, "you"? What? What do you mean, "you"? I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head. But you said "you. So what? Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody. You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month. Did you ever fuck my wife? What? I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met. Whadda ya mean? Did you ever fuck my wife? Whatsa matter with you? You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie? I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy. Well, it was nice meeting you, again. Same here again. By the way, what's your name? Pat Healy. I'm nervous. Trust me. Don't be nervous. Why? <u>I don't know why</u>! Oh my goodness. Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually. How come you're not on the job? I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out. How are you doing? Not too good. He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me! It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur. One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether. Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock. Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one... What's that? I'm taking a piss. I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin? Dante's Inferno. Yeah.  The Inferno. Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...? Lowell? Nah. Why not? You might be the only one with a job. Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what? To do what you love. I don't know sometimes. You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse. A horse? Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on. Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive. And you wouldn't be. Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex. I'm... really sorry. Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction. Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go. Hm? You know, clean the pipes. Pipes? What are you talking about? You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates. No, no way, I couldn't take that... Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise. Second one of your friends to end up dead. You didn't tell us you knew the dame. Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett? I can't comment until I get paid. I thought you said we were going to the movies last night. I say a lot of things. And like a fool I believe it. Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's. Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet? I don't know! Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months - Please, Sidney, I can't stand this - It has to be, like a socially conscious theme. One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them. But, hey, maybe we can be friends. Sure, that would be cool. Friends. Okay. See you later, friend. Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh... Homicide. Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent. Let's go. Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it! Ilene, are you crazy? I know what I'm doing... Go! Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read. Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs. As do I. They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug. They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true. You've got to respect that. I have to say that I'm not there yet. Where? Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond. I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to. I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist. You are a therapist, right? No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment. I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan. Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid. How's it going? Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course. Paper or cloth? I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded. What's the larger experiment? It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans. Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan? The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels. I'm not sure. Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm. We are animals after all. Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world. They said it would be okay if... We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh... You got a telegram from head quarters today. Headquarters!? What is it? It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news? I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety. I'd be safer sleeping with that snake. Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it. I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'. Give 'im a fryin' pan. You're kiddin' me. Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day... I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime -- -- my loss -- -- even if I give you a million as well? Wouldn't know what to do with it all -- Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight. I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ... All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand? It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock. I forgot about that. Can I come home with you when we get there? Yeah. It's ok to ask that. I thought that you were anyway. Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am. Say hello to your mother. Do say hello to your mother. What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all. All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney. My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once. Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. These birds were... What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. I can't see it. It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is! Hey now, what is this? Ask him. Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff? Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo. That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one. Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he? I do not know -- and even if I did... I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side. Get lost. Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you. Wash up and go home. Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots? Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing? C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now. I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me? Are you out of your fucking mind?! Fire's out, isn't it? My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago. You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you. Start killing people for real? Suspect Zero. That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so. But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low. Well? I don't think so. Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the -- --Nooo-- --Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened. Do that again. What. Smile. Wow... If you like that type. The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away. Is that the last thing you need? My your clever. Where do you want to do this? Probably the bathroom. Can't you do it out here? Check you later, man. Hi Gina. Don Maranzano. Welcome. I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see. Good liquor draws a good crowd. I must know more of you, my son. Not a lot ta know. How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that! I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore. You don't trust me. I have no reason to. Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would. And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions. All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you. No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog. Jennifer gave her a make-over. Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved? You have an unusual hand. I could have told you that. You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split. I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up. As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice. So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- -- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it. You think it'll send this guy back to hell? Correct, And that's when -- You will die! It will be awful! Every man dies. Not every man really lives. The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing.... Feathers all over the place.... It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them. Say, this is Snugsville. Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot. No kidding. Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center. Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it. Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise. I'm with you, lover. Why? Why are you doing this? Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit! Where's Bill? Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK. Good night, papa. Good night, my little darling. Papa? Yes? One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa? What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story? Now what is up with <i>that</i>? The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA. Cool.  What'd it do to you guys? Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time... Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next. No. Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time. Why do you call it an investigation? I never have. Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her. What does this have to do with..? Why you hang around with them greasers? A girl needs protection. Yeah. From the likes of them. It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up. Yeah -- ? Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on Just the missiles. They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles. Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock. Speed? Between Mach 3 and 4. Call them every five miles. Thirty-five, still straight. John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John? I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some? He'll be atop the portculis ere long. Best get down close to the moat, lad. Aye.  We're good as inside. It's what we'll find there worries me. Read it back. To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family? Oh, shit, that's not right. So... I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in. Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money. A whore fucking. Who is she?  Do you know her? Sure. You hustlin' me? Where's your back-up? No back-up. You're not following procedure. Procedure went out the window a long time ago. Respect, I always dished ya respect. ...Ya gave Dipper my locker. I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager. The fight's set -- I don't need a manager. Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience. I got pain an' experience too. Please, kid. Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none. You want to go down or stay along the river? We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back. ..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here! Who are you talking to Jack? YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!! Bingo! How many? Bring 'em all. Let's move!  Taking it down the hill. You're--?  What?!  You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing! Then stay... ...here! Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on. I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours. That was easy. You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't. I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense. What's it doing, having a seizure? It started crashing around right after we locked it in. Now what? I guess we open the door and net it. Jesus... What is it? Where's Casey? Casey? Casey? No-I guess not. Yayyy! Betsy, come over here a moment. What is it? I'm busy. Just follow me. Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells. How many? 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch. 25 kilos each, huh? Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one. She's not in love with him -- or any of them. How can you tell that -- from here? You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you? My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff? That's right. Beat it! By the way  what happened to your leg? I was jaywalking. Did I hear something about jewels? Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news! We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille. You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go. Roll 'em. Action! The scene starts. Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request. Oh, hiya, Pete. So, no goat hooves, huh? I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going? Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub? Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something. So why didn't you kill me then? She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive. Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this. Come on, Jonah -- Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton. Maybe she knows your old man. Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive! Of course they're alive.  All nature is living. Glad to meet you. I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with... No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida? Yes. I wanted to speak with you about... Well, we'll do that this weekend. My wife told me to look into... Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities! Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory. Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to... Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally. Aroused and inflamed. Alex. He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't. Do you really know Superman? We get together sometimes. Who? I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out. But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help. In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers. Please, call me Gale. Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok? What. There's been some trouble downtown. What kind? What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying. Our black friends? No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message. I thought he was in prison, in England. Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you. --and certain chemicals involving proteins -- You left something out. What's that? The Breath of God... Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover... Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for... What a perv... G.G. Market one-eight-four-two. Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold. Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange. Thought it was my week for that. I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel. Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom? SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course. You touch me again and-- And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece. On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling. He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments. I bet you could do a book. No. I couldn't. Why do you say that? Because I already tried once. But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin-- Yes Basil? Be careful! But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now? You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice? How'd you do it? Do what? Get her to act like a human The infamous dog? He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea. Ours. It's Jerry's worst idea. W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --? That'll do. Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later. Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers. Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present? Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady? Because I dislike her too much .. O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him. No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>. Where are you trying to reach him? At his office in the Capitol. If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56. Did you get that, Kulnick? It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next. I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie. It's so hard to believe. And you honestly expect me to believe all this? I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business. I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career -- Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that. So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet? Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole. I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet. I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back. Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all? Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours? On screen. Admiral -- Do it, while we have time. CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?! Yeah. There's some maple walnut in the freezer. Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy. Just a little... What's the difference? OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right? All right, Kenny. I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime. Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo. They're filthy, Mother. Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it. I know, Mother. But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it. I am in awe of it, Mother. I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil. Oh, Mother, not the castor oil. This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that. DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!! DROP THE GUNS! NOW! Craig, remember what I told you. I'll remember. Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean? Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile. Good. I say we head out. Agreed--let's move it. Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley. Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request. Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you? I don't know, Brian... I don't know... It'll hurt the box office. They know what her tits look like. I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one? I don't know. Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out? I know what I look like. Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight. Annie, I need a file. I'm sorry.  I can't.  I.... Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky. It's also been a long time for me.  I-- You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around. That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this. They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something. Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless. Elena. Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here? I'll drive you -- Ben. That's right. Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy. That is so right. Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley? Now, that's really stupid. So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we? Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother... Stepmother. ... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free. This is our Colorado Lounge. Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon? Perhaps some tea? I dined at the prison. Ahh. Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse... What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you? Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you. You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it. How would you propose we handle it, Doctor? I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason -- Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place -- For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try. How's your star? Gosh, you look nice. ...what...? That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were. They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them. The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things. I don't think you understand me, Court Composer. Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart. Why not? Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming. Oh? How about some ammo? It's loaded... I got some shells in here. Which way?  Which way? Duck! The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid. I hope you're ready for this. You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now. You gotta plan these things. And I got it all planned. I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights. C'mon.  It's not that bad Try lookin' at it from this angle How come nobody knows about him? And you do? I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to. Why are you doing this? Because I want to. Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice. James called me last night looking for you. When? The usual, 9:15. He probably wanted to drive over. Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting? No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him. Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"? I don't know what to do. You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable... You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable. That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well. Fine. Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child? Six. Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter. The deepest, darkest secrets --'? Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free. What do you mean 'free'? Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear. Who is this imbecile? Where is he? I wish I knew. --  Oh, God. Zod.  Zod. There shooting at something. Doug? Turn around quick! Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault. I still thought it was a purse. You're going out. Yeah. You're going sailing. Maybe. Take me. No. I want to go with you! Quiet!  Shhh! Michael.... Okay, okay.  Close your door. I'd like an ice-cold Heineken. That sounds good. Two. No, wait... please... listen... No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp! He didn't leave us. You are a resilient man, Mr. You missed. Any time you decide to let me in on it. Is he going to see this? Absolutely not. It's not over, Brynner. Sir, we can't just let him get away with this! Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off. All right, let's move... There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you. But only you will know he's not human. We must prepare for the coming of Gozer. Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something? He is the Destructor. Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom. I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister. Yes? I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson. I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here. She's very beautiful. The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary. Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past. Maybe, the Professor could help you with that. By reading my thoughts? If necessary. What if they're naughty? All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now? The National Safety Council would be appalled. Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool. When did you get back? Tuesday. Where'd you get that dress? Do you like it? It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them. Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick. She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say. Out! Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass. Aye, sir! Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart. I love you, Lotte. Maxine... Cell phone. Shit! ...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi... You eating with us? Yeah. Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door... I was right! Step on it! Let go! We've got to stop! Now you're the one that's out of your mind. Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us! There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ... Y'mean take off our costumes? Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ... Same here.  So why'd you come tonight? You first. Dad... Oh... Dad! I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them? Victor did. You look like dogshit. He looks a little shrunk, that's all. Does it bother you to hear? Nothing you can say will upset me. He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53. See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place. Anything specific? You know...like restaurants, night clubs... What is it now? Don't ask. General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here. Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold. The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te? I am.  He has always been our greatest protector. I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you. Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade. You use it justly, you're worthy of it. It's time for me to leave it behind. So what will you do now? I terrible with mechanical things. No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you. Mr. President. Admiral Donald...Bill... Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted. At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law. She's great. Gimme the money. First you and me gotta get a couple things straight. Well, that just about figures for today. So...where's my truck? It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five. I did what I could for you... ...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck? I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off? Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear? I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it. Someone stole my backpack. Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there. Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right? Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad. What are you saying? I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to. Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But... Yes. Take the test again. We must go, Holiness. A moment. Hi Dad. Hey Jeff. He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he? He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out. Are you sure? Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory. Round up who you can and put them on standby. Think we should call the local P.D. out there first? No.  I want this to be all ours. Why are we here? She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her. Who? If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all. Why not? Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing. Hey, just shut up. We're gonna die! Arlo, shut up.  Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known. Always.  Ever since the day I died. Honey.  Let's go. Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help. No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder. How do you know they're done? The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed. Whistler! Go on, I'll be fine! Can we get this car there? Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator. What's wrong? What do you make of this? What is this?! ... It's Harcourt. Harcourt is dead. No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're... Tell me about it... Jackie, if I thought for one moment... You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children. Don't you think you're overreacting? Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide. ...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there. What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there? Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone. That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold. I know what I saw - You know what they're doin' now, Lou. This I know, Benny. This you're familia' with. I hate to say I told you so. Save it. We got a long haul. Clear and rolling. This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it    your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband? No, she's with her sister, Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup? Fine, thanks. Stop! -- Made you say it! A little melodramatic, don't you think. I have a flair for drama. Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room? You wanted an answer to your question. Annette? I'm afraid so, you want her? But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count. Jamie! Get away! Don't touch him Jamie! Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do. I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...? Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>... You see I couldn't shout that. Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative? No... go on. Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it... God bless you! Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse. I'm going back to the hotel. Good. See you next weekend? As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due. Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions. Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.. Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room. Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier... So where is your roommate, the model? You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve. Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends. You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts. What's on your mind? Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go. I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know. The world can wait, Jon. You're going. Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive. What's wrong with it? You look like you just crawled out of bed. No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on. What are you going to do? - Charlie? Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda. Very pretty. Now what? I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money? Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that. And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it? Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over? You're out, Dyle -- right now! I better get going. You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment. You defend yourself admirably... ... for a commoner? Thank you. It was everything. Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down. Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house. Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense? Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door. May I offer you a drink? Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience. Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here. You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps? Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry? Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me. Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer? I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy. Z, we've known each other a long time, right? Of course.  You were born two seconds after me. And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow. Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid. How do you remember this stuff? Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s. Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know? Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead. You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face. I did not want them <u>dead</u>. Did to. Did not. Did to. Did not. Where... where are my clothes? Those are your clothes, silly. You son of a bitch, you know what time it is? We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found. Guess that'd be me. Again. Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation? Me. And who do I go to about you? One. It's Ru'afo. Can you beam him off? Negative. He's established a security field around the control room... Is there any other way to disable the injector? After the kids are back in school. Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents. You used to call me "James". You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you. Everybody's got a gun.  In this city... Milo. What's up? Well -- you sent for me. Right... Right. You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him. I just want to be a superhero. That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy. I needed to know. You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent. I'll call you from Detroit, baby. You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead. What's going on? Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight? I think so. There is some allusion here that escapes me... We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we? Why does everything you say sound like a threat? So you're stuck with me, eh? Maybe those Russian dames would take him. Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it. Okay, but it has to be a small one. Everything is going to be just fine. This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want? No, almost never. But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind... We didn't tell him any different for years -- Your parents are divorced? Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress. How do you -- the two of you -- get by? Materially or spiritually? Either. Both. He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma-- The Trail of Tears. They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee. So they stayed in Florida? They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass. Hokkaido Island. The systems integration site. Mmm.  Look closer. Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine. You must be new in town. I'll have me some of that punch there, too. Donny -- Donny-nothin'! Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them. He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime. Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make. Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy! Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode. Hey -- See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason? Mmm. Mmm, what? Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman. Huh? The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception. Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't... Yeah. I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater. Is there something wrong with the phone? In the living room. Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed? Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was. Are you serious? Yeah. He said that. You must enjoy causing me pain! You shouldn't have pushed us! Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye. What's up? He wants to see us now. Where? He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know. We're getting whacked. We're not getting whacked. Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is? It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan. Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes. Great, good. Everybody okay? We're all here. Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought. You busted?! What?! You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!! What happened.... Where are you taking him? I am going to lock him up. You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary. I'm not going anywhere. I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power. Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun. Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world. You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains. Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive. A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in. It s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I m the victim. Please, Cotton, don t do this. Come on, come on. Who was it? Just get your clothes on... Mom? Yeah? You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what? Q! How are you? Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore. I'm sorry. It was a national emergency - That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here. Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English? Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper. Do I have to dial '9' to get out? I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next - He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf? No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me! He's already angry, I don't think -- Just because he doesn't like Americans! Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking -- You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan. That was lovely. Will you do me a big favor? I'll do anything for you. Would you like to make a man happy? Yes -- I'd love to. Then dance the next number with Kringelein. Why? I feel sorry for him. You're not a bit like you were yesterday. I fell in love last night -- the real thing. Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist. I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein. Anything for you. What <i>is</i> this place? You've never been here?  Let me order for you. Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break. Relax, you'll live longer. We're within range, sir. Beam them directly to Sickbay. What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep. Did Vaughan go home? Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too. Did Karl go to bed? I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop. I bet he don't. Karl likes me. I know he does. Mama? Huh? Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about. Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right. Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he? I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you. I love you, too, Mama. What the hell you looking at, girl? Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing. So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you? Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there. You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement. You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children. If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to-- I didn't tell anything, I told the truth. You version of it. There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life. We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries. It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never-- InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it. What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store? What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police... Ever been tempted? What? To put one of these in my pocket? Uh-huh. If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right? Yes. All those things are true. After all, it don't belong to nobody, right? That would be one point of view. Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now. How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second? I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende? Si. Quarrel sir! no, sir. If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you. No better? Uh? Uh? Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises. I will... I promise. Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot. If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be. The way what is going to be? I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat. What do you mean to do? Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it! BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this. Jesus. Do it! I want to get HIGHER! He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow. Wait a minute - Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in... For him? Yes. You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth-- Who paid the bill? It's a company... MPG Capital. I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army. Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders. They'll have units blocking us up ahead. That's why we're turning off onto a fire road. Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine. I'll do it. Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that? Please. Get back into bed. I have to speak to my father. That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed. It's important. You took quite a beating. You must lie down. I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim. The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. Hey, where'd this come from? I found it. Where? The closet Yeah? Give this to Joey, will you? Oh. Do you know something about that? Why do you think I called? I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things. Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic. OK. You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side? Can you use these? You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton... I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should. That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves. What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon. And a missing man. So... hi there. I don't believe we have anything to say to each other. Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen! I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in? I have a loft. My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight. Jesus Christ... Why are you so good at math but not in English? I'm not good at math. Just geometry. You watch that mouth. I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like -- The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star. What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy. You could be swinging on a star. Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is... You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger. If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead. I ordered you to defend this ship. You ordered me to kill my brother. Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't... No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek. Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were -- Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing. Yes Sir! How are you fixed? I'm okay, Matt. You've got enough? There's a call for you -- For me? -- Mr. Sheldrake. I don't want to talk to him. I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay? I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church. Father, I have nowhere else to stay. You have a sister in New Orleans. Hiya, Doc. Martin. Did you straighten her out? Well, okay.  There's this girl... Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend. She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside. Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it. Congratulations. Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody. Cotter? Fucking owl! You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to? No idea--goddamitt! Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake. I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark? Can't say. Then who's the Banker? The King. What for? Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment. Ten flights? You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street. All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify! Get a stenographer. Can you believe that was me? Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history. So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything. Everything. If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet? Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths? Dude, we don't have watches. Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror? Don't. What ? Don't eat at the console. What ? Are you my mother ? It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away. Yes, sir Mom. Where have you been all day? I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi! Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?... No. Well, she wants to fuck you. I deserve a lot worse. What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit. Lula, you there? Yeah, I'm here. You upset with me? No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too... Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it". Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning. Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from. I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal. I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state. All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information. Is Jeremy okay? He's asleep. Oh. And they're leaving the country tomorrow night. Bastard. I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow. I'm calling the police. Right now. You can't do that. Don't tell me I can't -- They're trying to kill me! -- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds... Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset. Uh-oh. D'you ask the patient when did she last eat? Yes. What did she say? She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital. One hour. Yes. And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour? I did. A single hour. Yes. Why don't we beam it up? Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that? Not from here, no. Hey! You shouldn't be down there! FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!! You said we were special. I meant everything. Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles. Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem. You pitch, baby; I'll ketch. The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that. Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three. Good-bye. If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me. I won't get lonely. No!  No!  I can't do this! Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way. But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin! As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence. Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy? Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys. Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed. If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway. What stuff? Morality. I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed. Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive. First Wes, now you? I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy. And you; you've got it all together. I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close. That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death. S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...? ...I'm sure that people are upset... You mean--here? Baltimore. Pure city-dweller. But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes! City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em. Have you always had to--work? Since sixteen or so. I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh-- No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator? It hasn't been easy, has it? No complaints. But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well-- Have I? I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help-- I don't see where we are *with* it. No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I? Go right ahead. Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--? Terrible, thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name? Why? Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders. I also answer to whistles. You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you? Look--I think we ought to skip it. All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something-- Well, if it's all the same to you-- I know. It's--Violet. It *is* not! Abigail. No! Letitia. No! Lena. No! Stop it! I've got more. You better tell me. You win. It's--Clarissa. Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go-- Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name-- Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful-- And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think? Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write-- Here we go. Great. Swing up, son. What? Up you go.  Right now. Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem. Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset. Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant. And what would you do? Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that. What cop? This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 * Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom. You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are. Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late. Thank you so much. Good night. Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender. I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither! You told them, didn't you? Don't try to be a policeman, old man. What did you expect me to be - part of your... Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think? I think most people right now have other priorities. Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here. Why?  'Cause you know him? Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition. Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV. Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it. Starla, it ain't -- It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it. Couple a hours. Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy. Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money. No.  You took care of rent, that's enough. I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away. I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day. I am? I mean why? Oh, honey, don't be totally naive. I'm not. Maybe I am. No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser. You guys? We're here brother. You gotta keep going. It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark. I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife. I feel giddy. But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me. Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so. It's true. I can't live without you. And this too shall pass away. Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you! Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more. Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my... I'm sorry, Mitch. Tribuus... tomorrow. You're coming back? I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand? And you're gonna tell me who. Who ever made that. Wait. Don't. I don't like things that make you cry. I just want to look ... Does Phil know how you guys feel? I don't know. You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all. That's always tough. How long were you together? Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend? No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's... Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years? Uh, not today, but -- John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table. I understand your anxiety. Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the... Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend. Richter-we got a problem! Ohh? Uh-oh. So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty. If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you. You're kind to be so encouraging. I think you'll do very well. He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it. He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us. You can hit me, if you want to. No, please. I won't. What's wrong? Just stay out of my face until I'm gone! What do you imagine this is? Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive? My leg is falling asleep. It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes. I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep. It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up. Fine. Fine. Hello, Tom. You here again? What do you want? Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians? I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff? What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything... WILL YOU STAY? WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU? I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN. I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky. Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be. I have kept it. It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish... What, Ben? I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma? Yeah? What three words, Harry? Pick 'n' Save. Hm? You heard me, Pick 'n' Save. How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing. Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four. Look she's upset -- No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh... Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did. Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class. You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there. Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me. It's starting to swell, is it painful? Yes. This isn't happening... The amulet... I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy". Hey, man. At least it's Disney. You know anyone's who's taken it? That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side. Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything. Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you. No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out. Hi, Buffy. Hi, guys. Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko... I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury. Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet. That's it, It's go time. Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it. Yeah? Wade's here. And?  Then? I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country. How could you know? I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home? You know America? ...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed. Why were you so late tonight I was showing Sonya something . . . What were you showing her? How to read. I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore. I know, but I had to because . . . What's this? Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone? Sit down and eat--you'll be late. It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something-- No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward. Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea. And look what happened to that. If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate. ...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys - No, that's not it, Jerry. Huh? The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars. Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you - Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry. Well, okay, it's - Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30. Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then. Yeah, you already said that. Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and - I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. Okay. I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense. Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out. You want your own wife kidnapped? Yah. What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it. Sure, I think it's swell. Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real. You my partner? Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division--- Are you a cop? Yes. Well, that's good enough for me. A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily. Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars and I need it quick. I'm in a jam. What's the thousand bucks for? To tear down the Walls of Jericho. What! Never mind . . . Listen suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled. Huh? That she's going to marry somebody else. You're drunk. Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you? If it's on the level. Well, I got it, Joe. Who's she gonna marry? It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours. I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk. Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail! I'd put you there myself. Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either. Who's the guy she's gonna marry? I am, Joe. You! Yeah. Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more. For heaven's sake, Joe stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level. Mmmmgh. Do they have those ... Where you come from? Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know. You don't know? Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment. I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard. When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage. No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me. Don't do that. What are you going to do? Hm? If you hit me... Yeah? ... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay? Your manager? Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer. Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right? Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay? Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily. The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke! She doesn't seem to like you very much. Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me. Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ? Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ? Open it. Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive. We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you. The details of my life are quite inconsequential. That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood. Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it... And she'll be alive.  Up here. This is Miss Kramer. Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me. More endearments. I like you, DIl Love me. Yes. Tell me you love me. Whatever you say, Dil. Then say it. Love you, Dil. You do? Yeah. What would you do for me? Anything. I can beat him. All right. Five hundred. We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah? No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel. You saw wrong. Huh? He's with the hotel.  I called him. What are you talking about? We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it. He was wearing a suit. He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak. How come I didn't hear anything? You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me. That's Lednov!  We come along here. And meet him there. Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up. What are you doing here? Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you. Will you go back to England? I have nothing to go back for. Here we go! California, here we come! I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason. Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it. No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend. Well, that seems a harmless fancy -- Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal. Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early. Is that right? I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference. You will? For sure? Yeah. We'll be on teams, me and you? Yessir. It strains me past the compass of my wits. If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently! Hold Daughter! Be not so long to speak I long to die. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua. What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning? Tell him to look through it. Get it. ...How'd you sleep? I don't know. Had dreams. Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting? Well they always is to the party concerned. Ed Tom, I'll be polite. Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night. We know what you're up to. Probably goin' out to get Williams. Simon, what's happening?! He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun. Can't we change course? We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down. In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here. Bombers. I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man. Get <u>out</u> of here! What're you doing with all this shit? Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it? Sure. So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that? I hope not. Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die. Med-kit? I guessed. But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back. You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain... I think you better leave. Melina, Hauser sent me to do something. I'm not falling for it. He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good. Get out! I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth. I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts. I didn't. You gave me a look! What 'look'? That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out... I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that? Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story? What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat? Then what do we do?! I don't know! Thank you, Martin. Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean? -- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality. Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here -- Who was the other man? I don't know    a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony. What did he have to do -  look at the body? We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful! What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?! Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse -- ARREST HIM! Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore -- How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it. Yes, very lucky. Tell me about it. About... About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl. Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking. That sounds a little fanciful... Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation... You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal. Excuse me? Are you talking to me? I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now. After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be. I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing. I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all. ... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts... They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe. It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist... Any sufficiently advanced technology... ... is indistinguishable from magic. What does it say? Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail. Nice one.  Would you like my phone number? Tempting but... no, thank you. Nothing is real until it's perceived. The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium. How? Is there an ashtray in here? No. Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke. Now what? There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us. Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing? I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed. You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well! Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too. Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way.... Yes. Why? This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you? On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time? Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule. What's your twenty? I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey. Not for long, you ain't. Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it. Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers? Theo? Forget who I am.  Where's this school located? 26th off Wilshire. Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me. She would if she heard my voice on the phone. I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right? No, Chippewa Falls. Right!  Where? Wisconsin. Uh, you're driving a- Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway? Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date? Yes. Where? A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us. And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham? Three months. And what is your boyfriend's name? Chuck. Three cents. Two cents. No more, Robert... No more needles... It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it. I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things... I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate? I'll tell you why! Nurse. Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady? I can't say. You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say. I can't say. Oh. Frankie! No more! You see? Watch! You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral. I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what -- I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals. I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me. Oh yeah? Whoa. Deja Vu. Sorry. Forgetful. You guys are playing music? Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here. You're helping Rajeev? No.  Rajeev's in India. Was she ever suspect? No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her. Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something... I just want to be alone.  Is that okay? One shot -- for emergencies. That's not playing by the rules. Rules are made to be broken. If you say so. I do. Did you like the first act? Yeah. What about the second act? That's taking place outside now. I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things. How is it back there? I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you. Good news. You're going back to school. When? Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back. The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left. You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks. The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ... Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ... Nowhere. I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before... Yeah! What's wrong with making friends? You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends". Are you afraid of anything? Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim? Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie. Goodbye, Charlie. That's what you think. You swine! Give me that again! You worm! Once more! You upstart! That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart. What are you doing here? Otto called - Hum a tune and I'll sing to it. The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found. That's a negative, Starck. Justin. Are you two okay? We've been better. What's going on? Michael Myers. Who's that? 10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle. By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates. ... I just pray we're not too late. Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you-- Aw-- --And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I-- Ma! Hold him! ... and you get nano death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones. Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is. I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you... That's easy for you to say - you're already dead. No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead. Why are you doing this to me? Well I brought something, I wanted to show you. What is it, your laundry? Huh? I want to stay. I said come on! Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and-- Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now. Do you want me to go? No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee? How do you do, Mr. Matuschka? Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs. Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady. All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes -- Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you. Too bad about Frank, isn't it? Yes, it is. I suppose you're pretty broken up about it? What're we having? My special, scrambled eggs surprise. Scrambled eggs surprise? How's Marcia? She all right? I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"... Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time. Mm. You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left. Oh my God! I mean, that worked out. Oh my God!! Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit. It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics. You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people.... Yes, I did. It's time for tea, Grandma. No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town. Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety. So I've heard. I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word. But how can it change every time? It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible. It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost. You're not lost. I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail. Ben is very ill. Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner. Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight? Why? Because I got some plans - I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza - And you'll be in all evening? Yes, Joe. Good!  Then you won't be needing your car. My car?  Why, you - Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'? Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me. It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat-- Spare me the aria, I know what you want-- I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--! I know what you want but it can't be done! Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up-- Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot! Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay? Okay, Sonny. All right. What are you doing here? Mickey told me to come back to work. High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation. Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert. So... What happened? My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What? Ma'am? Yes? Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign. I do not accept. Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion? It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone? 350 pounds. What? This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow. I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter. I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people. You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you. Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam. If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you. Thank you. Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work? I'd love to, at any time. You're having a good time.... I am. So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off... Oh, that's terrible, Reege... So I followed him... You followed him? I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat. You keep a bat under your seat? Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES? Yes, great movie... I was DeNiro! FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT! I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep. This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it. She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off? I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run. Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders! My legs are frozen. You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds. Sefton! What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog? Not you. What some brandy? Yeah. Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria. It's on me. You won't get off that cheap. What are the chances busting out of here? We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy. I've never done this before. Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl. I'm a little in the puke zone. Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly? What am I, five? You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one. Okay. You know the ten commandments? Yes. What's the first commandment? Thou shall have no other God before me. Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you -- We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us. God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead! No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look! Good-bye, Dil Jimmy? What? Don't go like that. You okay? Yeah.  How'd you do. They're calling me in to work. I should be going anyway. They did show up.  Isn't that great? I hope so. I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play. There is. Even your play. Oh And that was only my first try. Well perhaps better than my first. He's coming around fine. Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car. Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that. Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house. Yeah. So we're working? Maybe it's the wrong ship. Shut up! Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly. How? Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and  That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned! I'm sorry, ma'am? Cold is good! Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity... Why am I being lectured in this way?! Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest-- I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy.... The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all. Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them? You men are all so dreadful! I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado? Where's Mrs. Moebius? Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes. No Mac, please... I -- Don't look. Look, you don t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who s the guy? The Austrian? Who s the guy? Who s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I d have had to kill him. I think you should go. You do? I mean, it's your life. I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College. To learn to shoot cannon? Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty? Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS. But the island! The Shark. Where's the stiff? Come on. Be polite. No. I guess you're here for the backpack. Oh... yeah. You're sure about this? Yeah. You could keep it and rent it out? This is what he wants. I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day. Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want. What tied the room together, Dude? Were you listening to the story, Donny? What-- Were you listening to the Dude's story? I was bowling-- So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know-- Oh my God. It's coming out. What? THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!! Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please. I was having a nightmare. Excuse me, but... This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that? I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy. What's the decoy? Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief? Shoot! Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us. Staring at us? My mistake - she's glaring. Must be my wife. Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep. Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead. Pictures like this don't show up on television! Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up. No, it can't! No! Mrs. Leavitt-- --I'm not staying here! Let's talk to your husband-- --he's not my husband! Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure.. Nyah still on the property? There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them! So is the town, I notice! I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate. I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted. I ... I'm not gonna do it. What? Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just... Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you! I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors,  our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon... Starling...? One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they... You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police... No, I'm fine... really... You're all right... you sure... You gotta think of your old age. That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes. Thank you. Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian. Did we? Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right. You just stay out of trouble, Homer! She's a lyin' bitch!! Get it! How's that? Can you hear me better now? Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert? Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone. Yes, Sir! Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine. Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel. I'm not at the hotel! You didn't find anything. Nothing. Here, let's clear the path. Another historical inaccuracy. Would somebody shut this guy up? You're lying! Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away. You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute. Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel -- How sad -- But wait... What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know? Huh? Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow? Lookin' at? Good morning. Horses. You don't forget anything, do you? No. But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit. That's correct. Were you pleased with his work? We were satisfied. What's your shoe size? What?  Who are you? The whales...?! No power to the bay doors. The explosive override -- ? It's under water! There's no way to reach it... Go on ahead... Close the hatch! Admiral, you'll be trapped! Oh. Oh. Hello. I wasn't expecting you. When he makes that call. All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl. Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing? What do you mean? Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it. Hello, Benjamin. No. No what? No. Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this. No. What would be true, then. Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls... ...as of today, 89% favorable. Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>... That's my bag. Go to hell! It's more than what you're worth. You bastard! Yeah and you're a slut, so what? He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought. And though he's slippery, he still gets caught. Good morning! What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good? All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened? Like...? Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers. And why should continuing excellence cost more? Cost less.  That's the point. Is it December? What do you mean? Did Christmas come early this year...? Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can. Good samba dancing...? Zero risk. Cause you don't lose loads? Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free. And you're our thirty-percent partner? Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here. Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray? Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon! I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags -- Mop rags --! Like dancing? Not with strangers. You were him last night, weren't you? Yes. And he was with her. We love her, Craig. I'm sorry. We? Me and John. Don't forget me. Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with. I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare. No. Josie, this is real. Congratulations. I heard about that. YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL. That's the way I thought of them sometimes. Berries. Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children. And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck -- And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right? No way. One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack. It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank? What? I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them. What were you doing in a library? I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this! What happened? Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive. What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us. Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb. Good-bye, Paden. Findley. Glad to meet you. And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you? Now and then. Why, do you? A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose. Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there? Good question. Take a look at this. She's wearing a ring. You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery. Put the plates down.  It's over. I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did. You can't talk underwater! I bet you hear everything I say! Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him. And what does he see? The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them. And when he looks up? What does he dream about? Lawrence is getting derogatory again. Shhhhh, I'm concentrating! I think he's jealous of Havel. Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here. Here? In Berkeley? Yes. Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes -- But you're not enrolled. No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it. Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie? Yes. It needs batteries. Edgar, come inside. Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die. Didn't we play this scene before? Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die -- I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day. You really love flashing that thing, don't you? Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want? What else could it be? Maybe it's an exercise. Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich? Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager: He didn't call? He's with his friends. What kind of person doesn't call? He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes. If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment. Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here. Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar. Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere. All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood. How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace? He knows our defenses. Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night? Kiss my ass. Well. Was this all about the oil? It is my oil!  Mine and my family s! Dickie? Do you know Dickie? You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie. I told you! I knew it! Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you. How would you know that? He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it? So why did y... I did it for her. What's he fixin' to do, ma? Hush! Do you believe in all of that? Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller. I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something. You knew the place -- Hey. How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good. That is good, yes. That's enough, Kincaid. There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody. But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job? Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card. What about, ah, non-union occupations? Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week? I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ... Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ... The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me. Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right? You're news, Sonny ... How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot? Newsman, not ... Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us? What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ... I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me? You could give up. Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison? Of course not ... Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ... Does it hurt? Haven't you got a bullet I can bite? I thought you had to get to Miami. There's always a later plane. You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl? Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper. I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here. Thanks, Carl... My hair's getting wet! So's mine. Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon? Yes, sweetheart. So happy and so tired. He didn't see me. Waiter! Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it? I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow. Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it? That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi? Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first. My pleasure. It was at least as good as the sky. Really?  Okay! And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious! Neat. Goodnight! Blood . . . my . . . blood . . . Let's get you inside . . . . He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical- It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous. I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down. Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas. You've got a couple of hours, maybe. To do what? I can't answer that. What will they do to you? That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere? You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me. What's up? I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend... How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow? Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz. You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations. Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra. I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival. Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as  Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife. Thank you, sir. But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today. Would you like to see the wine list? Chateau Latour '64, please. I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie. Charlie! Am I dead? No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway. We're being hailed. On screen. Our echo. Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo. Allow me. Thanks. At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you? We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw! No! Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere. I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you. He doesn't give a damn about me. Oh, you're wrong. He told me -- He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him. Walter. It was my mother's. It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated. -- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me. -- we can't now. -- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you -- Been thinking? No. And I'm arranging deportation papers. Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you. And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me-- What's your name, buddy? B-B-Billy. Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy. How much for the phone calls? It's nothing. Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish... My God! The fork! The fork! I'm sorry? Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses. Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things. No biggie. Betty Elms? Yes. I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you. Very pleased to meet you. Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone. Goodnight Vada. Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo? Ahh, I just wanna look nice. You never cared before. Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together. Why? She likes to play bingo. Can I go too? Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company. Excuse me? Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room? He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here. I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood? Doc Mimms will -- Shush. Can you keep Sam straight? He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me. I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was? He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it. You're a good girl. I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson. All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke. God's sake, chief.  The President was shot. A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart. Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink. Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that. Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night? Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . . Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment? In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . . Yeah. It's Detective Smythe. Um... What? What? The costumes.  Am I right? What a touching story. You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs. What!? I said, yeah, about once a week! Oh! Wilson. Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf? What? Did you hear what I said? Yeah, but I don't know -- -- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears? No. Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears. I didn't realize it was that loud. And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand? Yeah. You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually? Who are "they? I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee. Then, what good are you? I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning. That's a lie... Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game. This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom. There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work. You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks. You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's -- I'm the only one who can cut him down. It's not a good idea, Hallie. Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is? Should I? A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...? Yes. ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case. The Big Boy did...? That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out. Huh. Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you? Me, too. Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story? Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service. I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer. Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English. We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked. You got Bank Americard? What now, Sonny? Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf... Let him go, Vincent. You mind?  I'm working here. You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh? Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question. A broken car? Still a car. You first. Why don't you get off his case? Promise you'll turn around if you get tired. I will.  Bye. Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room. Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard. Don't do that, you've got the whole garage. Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer. Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room. Seriously? Seriously. Great. What? My parents baby-sitter canceled. So? So I have to watch Jamie tonight. When did you find this out? This morning. Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit Don't get angry. I'm not angry it's just What's so funny? If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime. You don't seem all that proud. I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else. Heal who? The innocents we now use to stop the guilty. You're talking about the precogs... You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived. I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand? Yes, sir! Good night, Doctor. Good night! Did you call the Zoo? Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased. Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something? The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir. Good God. They suggested oranges. That's a big help. Where are you from? From? Are you from up there? Space? Space? Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from. Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here. Yeah, we're here. -oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is- -you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay- You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters- Don't I even get my face slapped? Would you mind? Okay. You win. If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz. If I change my mind. I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do. No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it. Absolutely fine about it. There's still good in him. I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared. But I had to help my friends. What is your name? That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter. Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much. Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here! Shut up! OK. Say what it is. The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter. L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera. Give me an ETA. An hour, tops.  Might be sooner. What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit? Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink. You don't want to say hi to your father? I'm sure he's busy. Don't you even want to ask? Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot? Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours. Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us. It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there. Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri? Forget about it, doesn't matter. Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table. He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run. The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you. What am I -- a dog, now? I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess. You have any children? What's going on here? You'll find out - soon enough. You're absolutely right, sir. Shut your bleedin' hole!!! Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man! I'm gonna take him, Goose. Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood. I want him! Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back. Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service. Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants! Oh no... The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass. And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included. If she pisses you off, you get another one. Do you know what she told me last night? She doesn't remeber a thing. That's good. Hey Jack, join us. No thanks. Don't worry, I won't report you! I don't gamble. I don't want to hit you in the stomach! You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach. Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter... There's just not enough of us. But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause... His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator. Bag him. You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling? Save him?  What are you talking about? Diane. Ssshh! Sorry. Shut up. Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this? Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean -- No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth. Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to. Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know? Geez! You look great! Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know. I see that! That's great! I'm hungry. Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday. What did all this stuff cost you? When you've got money, you'll pay. No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score. The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted. Don't you ever cook anything? Eggs. How do you like them? Raw. If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them. I understand, George. No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. Do you still talk to Sylvan? I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends. That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right? I will. Take it easy. Bye. Bye  That was Snowball. He's alive! He can't be far away.  Find him. Go! I am the wolf, cunning and swift! I am the crane, agile and sublime! Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid. Yes. Yes. That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy. Are they all as -- small -- as that? Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case -- My time isn't up yet. Is that an offer? It is not. Riordan? Antihistamine.  For bites. Damn it!  Chloramphenicol? Antibiotic. Parasolutrine? How do you spell it? P-a-r-a-s-o... It's a soporific. What's that? Causes sleep. It's like a sleeping pill? ... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up. Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name? Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you? How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you. You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos. Luck. War. That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to. Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now. Well, my boy, you're a hero. Fuck you. Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing. They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know. Those lying motherfuckers! I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it. What's up, fellas? Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes. Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment. You've got something going? Did you see that Central chick? Brunette? How'd you get this number? Who was it answered the phone? None of your business. I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you. That's my dad. Really.  He has a cop's face. How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet. And your gun. Think I could have them back? How do we do that? Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off. Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door. How did you get all of this stuff into the country? This is America. There is nothing you can not buy. Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart. I love you, Lotte. Maxine... Now you done it! You busted it! I never-- Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you. Oh? She's gotten into your equations. Then why the sudden exit without even telling me? Do you want the truth, Anya? It would be a nice change from you. I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious. You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice-- How'd you ever get away with it? When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me. Sure! I never want to go back.... Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who? I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you. Is there a golf course around here? Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls. I got there late, John. Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens   It won't happen again. Get out! Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore? Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted? Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden. This doesn't seem a little... perverse? There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday. It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up. Really? It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest. What'd I do? There it is, guys, the last of it. Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer. What was the top bid? Why, you going to make me a better offer? Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really. Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl. And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne. Dwayne? Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport. What's wrong with me? Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met. Why the hell didn't you do anything? What was I supposed to do? You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls. The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us. What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away. Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence... The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well.... A poison...? Let me give you an example.... Sexuality. Sexuality??? What do you mean? You ever fuck a Jewish girl? What??!? Did you ever fuck one, Guy? What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why? And? WHat did you notice? Notice? Like what...? Jewish girls like to give head, right? I don't know. Is that right? And Jewish men like to get it. Everybody likes to, don't they? Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why? Why? Because the Jew is essentially female. Female... Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man. Does that mean the Jew is the better lover? You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness. Danny, what makes you think you know all this? Let's just say I've done due diligence. So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt. The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society. Michael. Yeah? You want to come here a minute? They would, huh? I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other. This is all maybe getting a little too strange -- -- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young -- I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles. You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point. Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin! <u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u> Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy? No-one. How did she hide it from the other nuns? She undressed alone... she bathed alone. Is that normal? Yes. How did she hide it during the day? She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to. Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time? We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits. Who was the father? I haven't a clue. What man had access to her? None as far as I know. Was there a priest? Yes, but I... What's his name? Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate. Could there have been anyone else? Obviously there was. And you didn't try to find out who? Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes. Why haven't you asked her? Okay to say something now? Go ahead. I should've danced with you. Okay. Good-bye. So long. It's John, isn't it? It's always John. Still wants to move out? He's been living out of moving boxes for three months. This kid just wants his freedom. It's not going to happen. The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free. Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie? Doesn't make it bad advice. Thanks for coming out. Neutral ground.  What's up? ...Priest... You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor. A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it. Zira.... It's red, Ford. What? Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday? Hopefully. Max? Let her go. Huh.. .Hello? All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point. Ted, what are you talking about?! Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on. Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna? Ha!  You tell me. It's a no go, Joe. Marylin! It's okay Joe. So waddaya feel like doing tonight? I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing? Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester? Which one was that? That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend. Oh, yeah. We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one. She probably got a date by now, Angie. Well, let's call her up. What can we lose? I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up. Well, what do you feel like doing tonight? I don't know. What do you feel like doing? Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you. What makes you say that? I could see she likes you. Yeah, sure. I'll call her up. You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up. You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo. That's right. I'm scared. There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared. Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us? No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ... Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him. No ... just keep him in here. Until you, or anyone else ... No, not anyone else - just me. Just you ... Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum? Not at all.  I'll catch you later. Clever girl. Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through? Yeah.  Some of it was fun. I got it Mama. I didn't see my Prednizone. I put it in, Mama. Well I didn't see it. Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags. Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before. You're cute. You have any money, Claude? Ten dollars. But I need it to get home. Why would you want to go home? It's so early. What I don't understand is how you got here. I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved. Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars. So? Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come? Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ... You want to get out of here? What? You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave? But where would we go? ... Lover's Lane. Lover's Lane! I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck. I'll buy you a new one.  I found her. Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it? Have what? Did she tell you anything? Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island... Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache... But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat. I wasn't sure if you'd make it. ... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown. Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to... He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin! Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to... I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak. Right, Chief. She's gone... Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump... All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick? You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey? Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay? All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis... First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk. Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper? Uh -- what? We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?! Oh -- sure, sure! Never better! Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine! Yes. We have a situation. The members are assembling. Is it an emergency? You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock. I can't stop thinking about you. Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill. What old mill? Is that somewhere we -- I just wanted to say that. Come by my house. You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them. I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life. You didn't have to kill Sophie. Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy. Show Mr. Van Orton to his room. The key? Hm? Is there a room key? Didn't I give you two? No, you didn't... Okay, we got it. Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive. Here and there. Around. Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably. Yeah, that's right. Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either. The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head. But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you? People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York. I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it? Thanks, but I'll manage. In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights. I can take care of myself. Don't worry. Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. Hi. I thought you wasn't comin'. Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money. Goody! Where's the third one, Travers? There, what's that place? Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him. Speakest thou from thy heart? And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both. Amen What? Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved. .... I'm afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct .... An Imperial probe droid. Now don't panic.  We don't know that. Have you ever known anybody a long time? You mean a woman? Uh-huh. What's a long time? Ten years. Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long. I'm still okay. Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact. He wants 75 back. Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody. Did you hear that? Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me. Knowledge I wouldn't want. No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen. You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson? Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera? Yeah-- Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks. Can we make it a hundred? Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff. We made it! Where's Jones? I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see... Letty, please. Some people. What's daddy doing? Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism. And you're at this third stage No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way. I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job. Oh yes? Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway. The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going. We got room for lots more. I say we go back. No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!! When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean? We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there. You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch. It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine. Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life. Something's wrong. Keep trying! An' all my meals for free... What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough? I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession... I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry... Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night. Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then. Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut. Then there was Jerry, the actor. I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and... I said, come here! I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble. Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl. So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera. I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there. You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world. ...Yeah. Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer. Who was it? Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you? Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional. Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases. The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that? Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway. I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues. First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man. You forgot "sexy". No, I didn't forget "sexy". Just didn't get around to it, huh? Oh, Tom, please. Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues. Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings? More people watch it. Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious, No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just... Just what? Kidding around... you know, fun. Dude here. Who is this? Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go? ...Us? DUDE Okay, til tonight. Tonight. You promise? Yeah.  I promise. Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing. Yeah, yeah.  Good thing. Okay. See you later.  Good luck. Thank you. Don't be late. I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that. This is only a vaudeville. Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me. Do you mean that? I do. I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things. Are you ill? The doctor thinks I am. But - What? I'm too young to be so sick. That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river! So they've been destroyed? I just heard. He's got my grandson, Sanchez. You be careful. I'm signing off. It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming. I thought all your equipment got stolen. All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net. I'll bet you're a real yo yo. A what? Goodbye!  See you! I'm not so bad. I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night. You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that. Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight. You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here. Yeah, you're right. You've worked with Elliot? I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him? There was a review. I think I remember. So does Elliot. Not one of Steven's finer moments. Oh. You know him. A little. And he has finer moments now and then. He has -- something. A funny little quality I find -- Endearing. Engaging. Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike. A little drastic maybe? Say it again. What? You know what. Alla puttanesca. One more time. C'mon, man.  One more sweep. One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip. Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it? Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this. Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well? I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through. Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott? He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook! Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you! I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick. Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby. We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this. Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds. Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer. So what do you think? Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too. I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy? Ten billion to one. ... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve? Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it. I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long. This is still a script we're talking about, right? I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress. Who is that guy? It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside. No, girletta, I don't leave your side. I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please. Stay still or they'll be blurry . . . Hurry up! I'm freezing! Just a couple more . . . I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage! Is there space here? Yes. Do you need anything else? No, no thanks. Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend. She wiped out her whole family. Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse. Didn't you study it in school? Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice. Yo! We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?  INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/LONG'S OFFICE - NIGHT. She's fine, Charles. Take it easy... Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen. And... he told you all of this? Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory. I... I don't know what to say. Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave. I'm not sad. You're not? No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him! He didn't ask me to... After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut! Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight? I'm going to have a word with that asshole. SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA? NO! GOD, NO... Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan. They got heat in Michigan. Not this kind of heat. Heat is heat. Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing. I'll get right on it. You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know? I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth. I don't really remember that. Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad.... Yes, yes, right. He won't go into the interrogation room. Someplace else, then. Where? Did I wake you? I'm up. I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today. Why? He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there? Give me twenty minutes. We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning. What now? We walk. You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one. I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night? Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job. This the place? Yeah.  How much? Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch. Horsefeathers! All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she? On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts! That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe! The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys! I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace. No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture. Do what you must. And who is this? Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR. Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive. Yes, there was. Can you tell me what happened? No. I can't. Was anyone hurt? May I have your name please? That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team. Good night, Polly.... Was it Venza?  Did you get him? No. You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon? Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it. I tried it once.  I lost my shirt. I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately. Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question? How much do you owe me, Curly? Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick. Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight. I don't know... I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred. Plus what I owe you? I'll throw that in too. Okay, you got yourself a boat. Miss Daniels? Is that you? Yes. Low mileage... Handles like a dream. So does Debbie. Your color. I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean. Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you. Well that's just typical isn't it? Is it true Phil? I gotta go. You weren't there, you don't know what happened. I know enough. A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar. At least. John? Hush, Pearl. Come on. I'll think about it.  I'm okay. Oh, you're more than okay. I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon. Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night. With an "o".  Harold with an "o". What -- you want me to retype it? Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley? Veronica is into his act. No doubt. Let's kick his ass. Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though. Thanks. Yeah. Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight! As long as we keep moving. No standing still. C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood! It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component... The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from? Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ... PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place. It grows on you. It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it. If the key's on him, how do we get the key? Kill him. Is that funny? It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way. Why? Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then. It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by. I didn't have any. You had no inner feeling? None. Then I must have been supplying it. We are being hailed. Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel. No, sir! No, sir! I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police. You know why.  You already said. What'd I say again? Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else? What? That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass. I said all that? No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest. Whatever. What now sir? Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed? All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested. Tonight's a good night. All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation -- You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself. Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died. How about the cop? Dennis?  I want you to release those people. Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away. We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you. I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them! Can't shut em' down from here. Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room. You like shoes? No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight. It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it. You going on a trip Mr. Parker? Yes. Where? California. Pike, please -- Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge -- Would you care to go topside? Very much. Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit! Suck my cock! Oh, Morgan! How was that? It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets... Better fortune, boy. I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus. You admire it? What is it? I don't know. Proceed inside. Alan, these aren't bones anymore. We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting. Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him? Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl? Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others -- What can I do? Except maybe pass out? Go? <u>Where</u> are we going? Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik. Say you promise. I promise I'll... I promise, Mama. Sing a song of sixpence. A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong? Nothing. Why did we stop? Scottie, why are we here? I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time. But why? Why here? Madeleine died here. You got my cell. Leave a message. It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it. Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho. Exactly that. Christ you should o' collared him right there. Who's on him? Some say that Hessians are invincible. They always say that. Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow. Always. What's all that gunfire? The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks. What happened? There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are! Who's moving? So, been married long? Eight years. I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky. Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars. Is this your house? Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say? I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain. Interrogation's over, Bedsoe. What? Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy. You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared. It's circumstantial. Forget your pager? What? I beeped you over two hours ago. Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees. On screen. ...Did you make that up? Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven. The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all. I can handle it. I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame? It's not history. So what do you want? I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it. Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want. To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you? Tired... That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling. A born freak can only go uphill. Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean. I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be. Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever. Does that mean you might have an assignment for me? Well? Well, what? Have you decided? All I said was that it sounds like a good idea. Did he...? Yep. You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem. Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans? Back, I suppose, slowly as I can. What are you doing? You'll beg for mercy in a second. Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane. What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it? Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir. Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone". One of his best parts. No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney. Ride the Clouds". Good picture. What's that? That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group. They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up. Nope. Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender. Three for three. If we stayed, we could make a difference. You're kidding yourself. You never know. I'm going after those horses. I'll take the camels. I don't need camels. But, Indy -- No camels! Will your girl friend get back to the city all right? Tom said he'd take care of it. I want to go back! Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go. For certain, no. But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning. For the third time, yes. With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how! You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window? You're fuckin' A-right, I am! With your own two hands? You heard me the first time! Well, I guess it's about that time. I guess so. Follow me. The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born. I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos? But I was on duty... How'd it go? You didn't see it or speak to anybody? No. Then it went well. Did it really go well? Define your terms. Do you feel good about it? No. Do others feel that you did well? No. Then what was good about it? I lost six pounds... Aaron, will you tell me? It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway? What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it... People phoned in. Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened. I'm not kidding. There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating? No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack. If all that happened, how come you're so chipper? I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good? I have to be somewhere. Where? Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look! I don't see anything. Maybe just a little. Holy shit, I'm a freak. You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal. You're staying home.  You're not going out. OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least? You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go. Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again. Good night, Daphne. Good night, Josephine. Why Picton? He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier? He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe. I don't know... what you're... That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day. Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983. Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting. I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome. We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting. I'm nothing then. Anything <u>but</u>, my friend. NIGHT NIGHT NIGHT NIGHT IT'S TIME FOR BYE-BYES IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY THANKS A HEAP NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO GO TO SLEEP Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room. Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard. Don't do that, you've got the whole garage. Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer. Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room. Seriously? Seriously. Great. Do you feel you're making progress here? You mean Ilio Manzetti? Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city. Alice... We gotta get the stuff and get out of here. We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go. Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right. Maybe it would do us both good. There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing. Dade? Yeah, mom? What are you doing? I'm taking over a TV network. Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday. Sorry man... S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station. Well? You really want to know, sir? Please. It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer. Your father doesn't love us anymore! What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me! Pat does projects all over the world. Where would I have seen your work? You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you. Never. He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do. That's not so. Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance... So you felt it too! Let him go, he said. Let him go. Do you? Oh do you, darling? Why certainly! Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel. Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals. When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near... Townsend, he had some of Father's books. Score! Yeah! Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty. How about a little game later? Fine--I'll be glad to. The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in Hell. I'm not here to fight. Just stay back. I want to talk to you. Kenny. Camera. Now. Watch it!  Move back. Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away. Night, son! And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl! Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side. I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them. What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me? Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us. Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes -- The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled. What's wrong? I have to go to the Diplomat. He's mooing. You wouldn't? What the hell you gonna do with yourself? Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal. What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification. I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases. He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ... Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because -- -- it was a betrayal. Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just... So what happened? I told you.  Nothing -- At the top of the Empire State Building -- I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here. Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it? Who am I? We do not know. Hey--what are you thinking about? Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about? My sword. Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds... But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb? Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?... Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around? It's pitiful. Neither one of them know. I think Daddy suspects. No, he doesn't. Not really. Quarrel sir! no, sir. If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you. No better? Uh? Uh? Awwww... So what's new? You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos. I'm still not clear on Chaos. It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine. You lie. I would never! Did you have so little interest in seeing me? To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ... You have no feelings toward ... No. They're waving... handkerchiefs or something. What? How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes. Maybe deMille is shooting. I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready. Yeah? What? Hi. It's Nathan. Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving. Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it... Take your time. What the hell's going on? I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew. Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor - I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do - Why is it taking so long? Here comes Daddy. Got a couple questions to ask ya. What do you do, Fink? Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got. Suit yourself. Too demure? I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence. Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming... And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got... And this happened before you and I hooked up? It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me. Racist piece of shit. I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to. He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in. Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- Don't worry about it. I'll stay. Ever been in a place like this before? Not exactly.  It's certainly huge. How many rooms do you think there are? I don't know. Should we explore? Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you? Certainly. It seems fine. <u>Fine</u>?  Look here! There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking. I understand. May I ask you something? Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want? I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on... Hey you're the guy from down the hall. Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night. WHAT?! Beauregard!  You scared me half to death. I'm sorry, sir.  You okay? Someone broke into this room. Anything missin'? Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless. You know him? Sort of. Well? We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions. Good. We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak. And where do we think we're going? I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window -- We're not watching the sea. Why would we-- Sweep the harbor. They don't believe her. Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet. Fine.  Phil, you still there? A prior engagement overcame me. What? Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy. Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband -- How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry -- I just can't believe you could be so -- I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away. No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill -- I burned the Christmas tree. What did you find out, Mike? I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere. Never mind all that. What did you find out? He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint. Dude Finlay? Yes, sir. Oh, man.  That's no glitch! It's alright, it's cool... Is it still moving? No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy... I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me. What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high. On a good run... yeah. So you're a wire junkie. Yeah, right.  You want to try again? Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time. They saved your ass, convict. One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story. I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron-- I've got to see you. But not now. Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval. It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron-- No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>. I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just -- It's all there.  Both nights. So... what do you have to tell me? Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you? What is it. Tammy? I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters. Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word. I did it. And when did you do it? This weekend. Exactly when? I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday. And how did you get in the school? Door was open. Which door? I don't know. All I know is I did it I I don't believe you. I have proof. Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right. Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important. Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright? Alright. Let's go. From Miss Johnson -- Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us? Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere! Oh, that's nice. The troops are certainly moving in here! Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command! I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now. You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance! What's an Associate Producer credit? It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise. Happy? No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow. Do you love me? Do you love me? I asked first. Sometimes I think I do. And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then! I never see you anymore. Where are you all day? I go to college. I thought you knew. Do you want to get some coffee? I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about. What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this? Are there medical facilities on Yavin? He'll be well cared for. This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up. Call you back. The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo- -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it- -now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so- Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain. So what's up? Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know. Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day. Sir, I recommend we raise shields. Not yet, Mister Worf. I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today! Is it true? You should be sleeping, baby. I'm trying, mom. Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth -- Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed -- Closer and closer  - until they bite into your throat! So what do you want with her anyway? I'm a good friend of hers. How do I know you're not lying. Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her. Probably.  One of the many. What? Nothing. This your current address? Yes. Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl. Who? Marty. Your son Marty? Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl? Were the lights on? Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate. They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment. That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning. Yeah. You disappeared on me. How long you staying? I disappeared on you? Alright. What did you think? I think it was a disgrace.   I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy. Thanks, yes, I think we did. One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed. ...have you come back? Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her. Oh .... I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so... What? Why? I got punished, man. Fa what? I won't let my motha cut my hair. Wha'? She fucks it all up! Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool. I can't man, I'm punished! I told you    I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you. Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings? I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class. I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings. Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you? She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts. I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk. Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...? Fuck...  I forgot about that. Drop it. Take him! Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system. You don't have the authority to do that. Yes. I met him last year. Go on. Oh yes. When he came up on business. Really? He came to see Mr Kinnear. No. Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em. When did you last see him. November the 28th, last year. You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit? No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th. Where is this thing that attacked your wife? I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage. Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator. Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator. Don't you think they'd just love another song instead? Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room. Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door. So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs. They hate me, they really hate me don't they? Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability. You believe me, don't you? Yes, sir. Here. What do I do next? Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport. Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque? Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque. --There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb? Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet. Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that? With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky. I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops. We're already getting complaints about frivolous search. This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets. Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow. Good night. Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying? You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you? You said that, I didn't. I can't! It's out of control! But how? Where's it getting the power from ???! Y'all come back. Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk? Hell, no! My sentiments exactly. Why are you doing this? The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion. Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas. What is the service, sir? There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet. Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning. I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke. I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we? Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry. So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying. No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ... I expect more from thee, Richard. Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone. Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about. Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it! I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child. But you have treated me that way. I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again. Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least... Yes, quite. We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane. Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that. What did I do? You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do. All I did... You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight. You're hurting my arm. Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go! Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby. What's the matter, Sugar? I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty. Hi! We had a date. We did...? Where have you been... I've been thinking. Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...? I have to tell you something... Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't... I wasn't doing business. Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian... It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j... Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...? It's all over between us.  I've found someone else. Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us? I'm sorry. Who is this person that you've found? He works on the movie. No.  Don't tell me that. I'm sorry. Why, you <u>whore</u>! He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him. Does she fuck? I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties. She's no vampire. No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is. Foreigners! Fuck! Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they? Thanks, Lou. How'd you get past the guards? Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little. ...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember? Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young. ...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops. I never did this before . . . I have to tell you. Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it. Just do it. Atta-go. What good is this? To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place. You're welcome, Unc. What about me? I have rehearsal. I have to watch rehearsal. You wanted to see me, Mr. M.? Just wait outside. Tammy. Okay.  But is this about the posters? Possibly.  Please just wait outside. Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside. How long? She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket. Maybe she used another name. Ray thinks she was murdered. She's my sister, actually. Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss. Thanks for the lift, Cecil. Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke. And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about? I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now? Hey, Sonny - You did it! Let's move it, goddamn it. And Buckaroo Banzai. Come on--let's parole 'em. Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself. The King killed my son! The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King. Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort? Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right. How's Brad? A wreck. Check.  The quacks are willing tools? Fools! I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours. Time to check with Flavors. Give me the keys, Dignan. I can't do that, Bob. Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt. Don't threaten me, Bob. Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God -- Masry & Vititoe, can I help you? Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office. Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy. Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned. HARRY! MS. HELLER said not to talk to you. That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam. A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake. You did? Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin. Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate... Oh, you want to talk about your delicates? Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special. You and Lloyd chose the class!? Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch. Did he hold you up on anything? Snow, get up here, now. I'm not Snow. Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream. Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in. I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not. Will you let me go then? Big piece or little? Huh? Oh, no. None? I'm not much for sweets. Laura? Donna, are you my best friend? Of course... Eat your mustard. It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are. I don't know what that signal means. It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo. Why, you got a customer? The White House. You're fucking me. We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak. Who we working for? A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him? I know whose blood you need, to end the curse. Say the name, or I slit your throat. No you won't. I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows. You not with probation, one of those? No. You a lawyer? No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels? Are you playing tricks on me? What? It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you. I don't like it. Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you. No, you look like a hooker. Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk. Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? Sure.  For five bucks. That's ridiculous. The price just went up to ten. Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart? Sit... and spin. Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not? Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother? Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly. After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive. People have made mistakes in these situations before. I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be. -- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode! You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- ! So, you just get here? Yeah, from Boston. I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive. Massachussettans aren't. Course they're also so rich. ... Massachussettans aren't. How long you staying? I don't know, it depends. You like Florida? I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check. In case <u>who</u> checks? What the hell? Where'd you get that stuff? Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again. Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs -- We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt. There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain. Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again. That's right ... Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap -- I don't know anything about that. ... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ... It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it. The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink? I think I will. Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids. You should have gone to the funeral. I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months. What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet? No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her. That's it. You are good to me Sam. Don't mention it. See you later. How are we gonna get him out of there? We could fill it with water. Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money. You need it. I don't need it that bad. Do you love your father? Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy. Do you love him? Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity. Can you show us where they live? Okay, young lady, that's it. Like I give a fuck. We must sound the retreat! Not yet! Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later. Business or personal? Mary. Mary, we've got to get going. No, no. What's that? Tanks...coming back. Let's go. No. That was Higgins .... Jonathan Quayle Higgins ... Are you breathing? Yes. What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe. Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him. What about? I didn't ask him. Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy. It floated back up.  I had to take him out and -- NO! Is it the truth? There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting. She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett? I can't remember at the moment. What're you talking about? When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department. We've got one hour. Are you coming or not? I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright? Fine. What will you do? There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon. And don't tell her I told you. Secret's safe with me. You'll need these. Tonight. For the play. Don't make me sit through one of your plays. Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think. Since when did that matter? Let's not start that again. My back is killing me. Where's your elastic brace? I can't find it. You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble. I lost it. I lose everything. I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it. Terry?  What do you want? Hey look- It's ok, it's ok... It's not. I can't take it. Erin. Who? I don't know. I found him lying there. What are ya gonna do, call the cops? I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. You're welcome, Unc. What about me? Man, it's so hot. Gettin' up, Carr. A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard. Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow. Bravo! But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs. Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon. We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you -- How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection. Helena -- Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back. What are you going to do? I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car. Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner. What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager ! It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran. Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ? Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? Edie! I  I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows. I don't rate it. Go ahead, wear it. Was it a party? Something like that. Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right? Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting. The party? That's missile lock! He better be kidding! Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps! Dodge to Murphy. Murphy. You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400. What is it? I think you better see this for yourself. Frankie. You wanted to see me, Charlie? Yeah, come on in. Little slow tonight. Mondays. What do we do? I don't know. We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name? I don't know. Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later. We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman. Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS... Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne? It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him. You're sure... I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars! Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault. No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him! Oh. Gabe!? What are you doing here!? Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back. How'd you get up here? Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?! You got to go back now! Where's Hal, what's going on? Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you. Name's Duff. How 'you doing? Okay. Looks like you're doin' a good job. Thanks. Don't say much, do you? Guess I don't. Just so you do your work. I feel like I got you into this. Forget it. I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it? I'm sorry I left you hanging up there. It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out. To our assignment. What is it you need me to do? Helen, I want you to be my wife. I'm married! Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone. We're going to Paris? Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days. I don't know.  I have to think... Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable. Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war? Harry, Harry, Harry... It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event. What other people? Excuse me? Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling? Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know. I read the article. Exactly, Miss Teschmacher. Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he? When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations! You know, I like Tom, because hi... Bobbie, please. Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work. You'll work. I ought to belt you one, J.P. Raise a hand to me and... . ... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly. You'd be off the pier for good. I need something. Do you have banking connections? I have connections. Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock. We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas? Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off... Hey... I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas. Isn't this fun? Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in. The pages filled in? But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther. I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today. Right back to you. Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ? Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ? I wouldn't mind. What's this? My house. That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now. Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way. Well, I got some bad news and some bad news. What? He is your husband, no? Yes, but...  He was having an affair. Si. Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense. He's not finished. So really, it's good luck. Good luck? Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs. Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree? He's bound to slip up sooner or later. Take a drink! Ok. First decent idea you've had in a month. Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington. Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest. What! Not Ol' Honest Abe! And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days. Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents? No. How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed? Compensated...? How were you paid? I was given meals, and a home... 102  CONTINUED: Wait 'til I'm across! I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead! Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today. You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion! You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life. That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work? Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda - Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you? I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" -- Yes. But not as a date date. Why not? I'm not allowed to date. You promised me flowers. What? You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember? Sorry... I was distracted. Well there's something new. I need to... um... talk to you. Talk away, Professor. Not here... alone.  May we? Please? His curiosity is amazing. Mm. Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had. A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue. Who pays the rent on time. You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob. You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got. I've got to talk to you... I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all. But I understand you, Mom. I always have. Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now. Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon? What does your lawyer think? Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down. But you don't agree? How do you know? Why would you be here? I told you. I was hungry. Where is she? I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her. Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise. As brave as my father. As wise. Uh -- to kill the doctors? After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me. And I bet I've kept that promise ... Only one you've never broken. Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home. He's got a houseboat. I hate boats. It sounds nice. Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them. Houseboats don't go anywhere. Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind. It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house. But it's on the water. It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle. I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information. No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living. How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride. This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here... Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother? Can I please have a cup of coffee? We don't have any coffee. What is this?  The Betty Ford Center? Annabelle, how's your video rep... Luthor  -- You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip! Real effective security... You could have just flashed him your badge, you know? Authority still makes me nervous. You move well. Just trying to make it look real. Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room. Expecting anyone? What? Were you expecting anyone? Tonight? No. Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to? No one. I promise. Who have you talked to? No one. If I think you're lying -- Carl. CARL??? Carl did this?!! Last night... he tried to get it on with me. You're late. What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one. The boss called. Arthur fell ill. Why are the shutters closed? Someone jammed gum in the locks. Bunch of savages in this town. That's what I said. Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later. What have you got there? You'd look naked without one. Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you. Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are! What? Where? I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you? Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage. State trooper? Fallacy. The duck? Hearsay. I know the porn career's a lie. Hello. Get me the police, please. Where is Elaine? I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you. Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership. Shocking abuse of authority. I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying? Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious. I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back. I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves? Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why. What makes you so sure? Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror. Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ. Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long. Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut! It seems like we're getting lower. It happens when I land. Why are we landing? Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in. <u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>. Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head -- What?! Mu Bai...It's been too long. It has.  How's business? Good.  And how are you? Fine. Lemme fix you a drink. No thanks, Birdie. It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years? It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this? I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that? I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and... And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room... As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square. It makes me feel better. Does she ever answer back? No. She doesn't answer me either. What are you doing in my room? I didn't go in your room. I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out! Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast! Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig! Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name? Scraps. Can I hold him? Sure. He's a boy dog. Yeah. Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy? I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy. Thanks, yes, I think we did. One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed. I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business They're not really going to call security are they? No, I don't think so. How do I get out of here? Follow me. You talked me into it. Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig. Oooh, ba-by! She's lying. You didn't have sexual relations with him? I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you! Dwayne listen to me - Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest? I don't know what you're - Don't lie to me!!!! I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around? Yes, but no, I can't right now. Great place for lunch. Yeah, one of my favorites. You made the front page. Where is she? Good to see you too, Elaine. Why isn't she with you? Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private. Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit. How much? Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it. I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!! And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like. Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise. As brave as my father. As wise. It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady. Grady... oh. What's that? You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language. It's lovely. . . No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness. Are you happy, Zaltar? What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time. But what about other people? Don't you miss them? Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605? Yeah. Not going to open? I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news. How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure! The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife. You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch! I see you found what you was lookin' for. I did look, Charlie, but I-- No buts, Rita! Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong! Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy! You would do that, wouldn't you? You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright. And there's the Sphinx. The who? He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete. Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . . Go on . . . But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world. Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it. But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows! The wise snake coils before he strikes. And a skunk stinks! Why him? Shut up. You need help, don't you? I don't feel anything. Oh, Jesus. Why not now? What do you mean? How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom. But what about you and the baby? You need me. Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so. Yeah, it would be kinda great. It would be fantastic. But Dad'll never go for it. You leave your father to me. Geez, they look kinda weird. You just smile, let me do all the talking. How many times you gonna tell me that? As many times as it takes. Namely? Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere. That was nice. Uh-huh. Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself... I forgot the napkins. And the chopsticks and fortune cookies? What's the best fortune you ever got? They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you. In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust. Same sector. Metallic mass. Underground deposit? Negative, on surface... A manufactured object. There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan. Elroy, what happen? I threw my back, again. Aw, no lovin' tonight? Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight. Come on, baby, let's go in the house. For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow! What do you see...? Nothing.  Absolutely nothing- Yes. Papers, sir. Got it here. Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass. You don't say. I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell. Fucking A, my friend. The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht. Well... Yes? Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up. Ah... I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like. I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind? Of course not. But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners. What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid. Wonder how the war's going? It's got to be going better than this.. And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake. Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. Two hundred bucks? You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life. Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks. We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain. Do you have everything you need from command? He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this? Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit. That was fucking deep. Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it. They are? After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days. I guess not... It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it. I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers. You were never my guest?! That's right. I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?! Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time. Liar. Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point. He's lying. Corporate fingerprints all over it. Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on. And you weren't involved. There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith Come to the point, Dr. Honorius. Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ... Impotent cow. Muy Bien! The guests are here. Guests? Just like you always wanted. Fine. I'll go straight. What! Fine! I'll go straight! This was, uh-- Yeah man, it really tied the room together-- This was a valued, uh. I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies... What are you talking about? That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun. You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you. Just promise you'll do it. Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind. I brought you a present. Merry Christmas. A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present. Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream? I am not a dream. You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you? So, tell me, how s unmarried life? I have regrets. Write that down. Okay, what else? Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no? Course you didn't. But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! Dude, they cut out 92 minutes! Who is it? I'm at the door. Go way. I'll call a cop. Pop, will you let me in? Where the hell are you? Right here. At the door. Me, too. Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going. So... To happy endings. To happy endings. Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination. So where are you now? Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court. Shit. Get this! He called and invited me to dinner. What happened to you? I had a dream that Grandma died. Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are. She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right? Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter. I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize. That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning. I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them. Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous. Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time? Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name? Stephanie. Nice. I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary. That's me. And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead. Whoa. Deja Vu. Sorry. Forgetful. Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later. ...Goodnight, Rocky. Mrs. Peel -- ? Ask not for whom the telephone rings ... No, please! I beg you ... Walk over to the window ... Let it be rain, please let it be -- Stay by the window. By the window. That was my last. You've lost everything? I've no luck. Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... Raised lettering, pale nimbus white... Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card. Good morning, Dad. Hi, honey. And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up... Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new. They're new to us... ...taping?  What are you taping? I'm doing an interview. An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry. Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it? No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing. What do we do? We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot. What are you lookin' for? Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok? ok. You just move in here? About two years ago. Bit messy. Yeah. I'm a bit of a slob myself. Yeah. You and your boyfriend have a party last night? I don't have a boyfriend. I can't believe you asked my father's permission. I wanted this to be a date. The fall alone would kill you. It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold. How long ago? About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight.... Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes. What are the delusions like? Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean. You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are. I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you? I can't go through with it, I tell you. Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong. But why do you want me? Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive. My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time. They had to be dealt with! By burning down their homes? I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into... Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not. I said you were... I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you. You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you. How long has he been having problems? Since forever. Have they done blood tests on him? Yes. Only in the emergency room or when he was well. Emergency room only. Have they done skin testing for allergies? No. They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin? No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway. It's amazing these things weren't done. Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me. No. Actually, I think that's their technical name. Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results? Me. My home number is on this card. His home number. Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game! Nineteen! Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up. That's too bad. What do you mean, too bad? Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again. Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a  Well, you know how they are in baseball if a guy's mixed up in a racket  Racket? What do you mean? Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you? Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh! And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove flopped into a chair and has taken out his ocarina. Feeling better, Oz? I'm such a loser. That's the spirit. I thought we had to meet the Man. You do. When? Right now. Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different. So what?                                                    ] Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love? What are you doing? Who am I? I don't know. That's right. How you doin', boy? Fine.  Better. That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know? Nick? Yeah? This has been a real confusing day. What? Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch. It's tough to rhyme. I believe in you.... Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains. John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi... Jim Belushi...? Surest thing you know. Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there. What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here. Jake.  No.  No! Can we use our indoor voice please... I'm flying blind here God damn it! Elaine, it's Wednesday. Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company? As a matter-of-fact I am. When is she coming over? About now.  Would you like a drink? I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives. I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything.... No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner. Now by killer, you mean...? I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak. Jeez, Mary... I'm... Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you. I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway... That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us. Well, we didn't know that at the time. We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him. No we didn't.  He died on his own. Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape... Well, here we are again. Yes, here we are again.  Good night. Mary - I - excuse me  Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou? Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss. I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation. You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake! Help me Rhonda. Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass. Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask. Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie? Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced. Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town. More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip. Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers. Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor? Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave. No way... GET OUT!!! Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it... Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them. No? How come? Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like. We should have seen land. We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near. Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign... Uh... hello? Hi, it's me... Oh, hi... So, what happened? Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well... What? You're kidding me... Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk... What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date? Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye! You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it? At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving. You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you? In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch. Come on, I'll drive you in this thing. You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car. Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you. And my passport? I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer. I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her. Been over to the other mill? Yeah, I been there. It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise. Oh yeah? That's good. I don't need this--I know all about my condition. It's your heart--you ought to take it with you. Shall I get her for you? No, it's all right. I'll just watch. I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have. What's wrong, Allison? Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects. Delayed after-eff-- I want you to see him immediately. ...Milo? Hmm? I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean. No, no. Never. More champagne, your majesty? Here here... That means they didn't abandon ship. So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan? Shit!  Shit!  Shit! It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up. Who has your undies, Walter? Where's your car, Dude? You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life... Joey... ...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games... When I say 'no,' run for the door. Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window. I don't know what to do. That's ok, you'll figure it out. The bearer of bad news. We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead. What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter. Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not? How did you start the fire this time? I used an accelerant. Yeah?  What kind? Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you. You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you! They don't love me. They love Monkeybone. It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there... That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you. Can't you give it to me later? Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better. Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash? No. I couldn't see. Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried. How's it going upstairs? Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system. Welcome, welcome, one and all. Rick! Oh, no! He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God... It will be all right. I'll take care of you. Jack? Marcie? Ned? How did you know? Know what? That there was a gun pointed at me. I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy. But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did? Because that's what I would have done... Funny couple, ain't they? Yeah. If you ask me, I don't believe they're married. They're married all right. I just seen the license. They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this. Yeah? What do you reckon that's for? Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet. A trumpet? Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it. But what in the world do they want a trumpet for? I dunno. I'll send it to you at Glades. Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer? All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough. Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time. Someone s trying to kill me. I need the police. Are you in danger now? Yes, goddammit! Where is your attacker? I don t know. Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way. The safety what? Fuck that! Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy. Yeah, we're getting Martin. No shit, come on. How you gonna do that? I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that. I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep. Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers". I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan? Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy. So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script? That's ridiculous. Let him have his say out. What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made? On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does. Report. Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed... -- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee. My little Web did that? Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them. Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her? Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to. Just tell me about the money. Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun. He's after your money. You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep? Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money. If they're so rich, why are you working at all ? I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch. Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ? Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad. Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ? My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ? I wanna go home! Yeah, it's cold! I'm hungry. No, stay.  Please stay with me. Honey, I gotta start makin' money. Oh, all right. Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while. No, no, I don't want to keep you. No really, I can stay a while. Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well. All right, well, good night. Oh. thank you. Sure. I asked you a question. Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking. You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl? Tell me about it. Maybe later. How about in the morning. The morning? I thought I'd stay the night. What for? Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck. Ready? Nods. Let' s do it. Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him? Whatever. What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us? I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem. Forget it, man. C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus. Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night. Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones! Blue is phones? Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all! ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it. You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet? That's all taken out of context. Okay. Yeah, that's out of context. Okay. I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad. Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. Yeah? Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad. What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me? What happened to me? What happened to you? Yeah. You lost your control. I lost control? Yes, you lost your control. Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore. All right. A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... All right. ...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?! Yeah. You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife. My wife? Yeah. Now, what does she have to do with all this? Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident. All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation? No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point. Listen, I would - The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you. Hey, she came to talk... Please... ...to me. ...don't do it to me... She came to talk to me... Okay? And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out? Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that. It's none of my business? That's right, yeah. A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me. Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy. Wydell. Excuse me for a second. Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern. There is something to be said for silence Oh indeed. Cotton'. I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right. Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now. Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know? You found us in the Penny Saver? He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men. He left us. I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can. You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it? -- A man. Helluva night, isn't it? Yup.  Sure is. I'm not gonna carry you out of here. That's right.  You're not. Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together. Why did you do that??!! I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that... Why did you do that???!!! He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say? He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. Yeah, what'd you tell him? I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up. You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back? Nah. You would've heard somethin'. Yeah, what's to stop him? I know. I know. I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know? Yeah, but they keep askin' about it. Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do? What? She came to us on the Day of the Dead. El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country. Her dance has pleased me. Yes? They've made contact with the Reapers. Any casualties? Two so far. Not for us? No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger. Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock. I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man. You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it? If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters. They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you? Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them. Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position. Such as? Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do? Do I know who lives down there? You can find out. Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time? You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on. Pretty big chance, huh? You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this. What will you do? I don't know.  I really don't know. Couple a hours. Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy. Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money. No.  You took care of rent, that's enough. I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away. I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day. Oh, thank you! Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object. I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead. Why's that? Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive. Except for the last part, that one's not bad. B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another. I don't like that one. Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him. But we accomplish the mission. Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division. Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material? No, sir. That's a mystery to me. Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack. It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance. Okay, you're a thief. Yes. Yes. What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask. Aha, just what I suspected! You're not funny. Please don't cry. Please, honey. What are you sorry for? I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to. I want to go home. You can't. Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys. You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew? C'mon Tim, move down, damn it! Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick! Where was she? Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out. Well? You have changed since second grade. I mean, what do you think? You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain. Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny. She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip. So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement. Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need. Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it. I don't need it. You want Botox? What the hell is Botox? It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them... Why in God's name would I want...? No frown lines.  New watch? It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones. Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills. It was a gift from a client. Set one side for Bel Air. Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college. We did not. You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court. I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends. Denial is not a river in Egypt. Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again. Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you. Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please. Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night? Peggy Sue, watch your mouth. Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man. Ow! What's the matter with you? Toothache. Hmm! Come on. Why, honey -- Come on. You gonna tell me why? No. Are you wearing a uniform? No. Oh. Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with. I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me .. There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me. Still married, Jake? Nope. You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous. Why the hell we drivin' here? I just need to talk. You can't talk in Brownsville? I'm not sure where I can talk anymore. What's wrong? Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us? That black car? Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em. What's goin' on Paul? I don't know. You in trouble? Yeah. Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there... I didn't know you were going with him. Did you bring your grey suit? Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie? Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself. Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met? The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born. I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos? But I was on duty... Get away! I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master. What?  Ridden on a horse? Yes! You're using coconuts! ...What? You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together. So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea. Where did you get the coconuts? Through ... We found them. Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical! What do you mean? Well, this is a temperate zone. The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? Not at all.  They could be carried. What? A swallow carrying a coconut? It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff! WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN! Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!! Bloody hell, this is fun. Is Miss Scott staying here? Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes -- Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice. Thank you. How about it? What happened, Duff? Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say? Don't push me, Duff. Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken. What about that girl? She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh? No. But a small one. Abort.  That s an order. <u>Negative</u>, Golitsyn s on the move. We can't shoot in the Old Mill. I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we... It burnt down. Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you -- And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over. Sir? I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands. You're going to take her off my hands? That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club. You left your wife? Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head? Yeah -- Now what was your news, Baxter? It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home. Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter. Bud? Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ... Oh. I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne. Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime. Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup. No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend. And your worst enemy. Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna... Could you do it? No. I did. What about it? Well, Jeff put that out himself. Himself! No accents today. Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard. Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey. Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record. Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history. You expect me to believe that? It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever. Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though. Yes. I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something. I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines. Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion? It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark. What could cause them?  What's in the Core? It's complicated... How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core? They didn't have faces. What? That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject. It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from? When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way. So you saved her. Yeah.  But not for long. Man this is heavy! Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant? That was an awful thing to say to me. I'm sorry but you're... Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore. Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and... -- red nose and ears. I know, I know. We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case. I'm not going near any lifeboat! But Rennie... I'm not!! Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access. What's the code? Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out. Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John .. How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere .. You can't get away from me, Albert. I know. ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent. Thank you, Quince. But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week. Next week? Yeah.  Or the week after. You could train someone else. Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want! This is cheery. Who is this guy, anyway? .....Me neither. <u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...! Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance. Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!! Who told you that? He video taped you. That bastard! I thought he was a kind, gentle man? Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! Just get outta my bed. She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live! I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are! Do you love her? I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time! I don't have time... I need to know. Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again. I would like to have died in peace... She must be something special After Dark. I can't remember.  I've got to make some money. Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his... ...yes, yes, yes.... Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu... Excuse me, we need to make a call. I'm on the phone. It's important. So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying? Listen, man, we really gotta... I be off in a minute.  Say again...? Never mind. It's nothing. Anything else you don't want me to know? Nope. Just keep those wheels churning. Hello, Rick. Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle? I'm sorry, but -- I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll. What are you going to do? I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that. I mean, what are you going to do about Billy? I'm gonna keep him, why? Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it. Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child. All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand? Hey, Cheswick! Wake up! Yeah, Mack, what is it? I'm leaving. Goodbye! Where ya goin', Mac? Shhh... Walter-- Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here? Our" car, Walter? And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car? Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something. What happened? A miracle. Yeah, right to the cops.  No way. Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience? What? You can handle this. Jesus... How well did, er, do you know him? Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die? No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume. Legume? You mean, a vegetable? Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know... What do you mean, maniacs? Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas. Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws. It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office. Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why? Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me. You're lying -- Pull up my sleeve. Right arm. Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying? A real turd. Well... hope she'll be very happy. Let's get serious... Why are all these people after me? Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy? I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and... What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out. But you know who she was. When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press? I didn't know we had sailboats. It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered. For all those vacation days you got coming. I'll rephrase the question. Thank you. Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do. What's wrong with him? You have more in common than you know. Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician. Why George, you big softie... God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night. Thanks for the movie, Randy. Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling. Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them. Are you sure? Pretty sure. There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings. You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them. Got any good ideas? Maybe. Jamie -- I'm sick. Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow. What's the matter? Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records? It's gone out so quickly? Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off. -- You mean my Chief has it. See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin-- Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she? Fourteen, Harry. Right.  She's only fourteen. What are you blubbering about? I don't know... She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight. What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts. Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?! I can't see a thing! At my house...! Call a cruiser! How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom? What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial? Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom? Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth. Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death? He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it. Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile? Been waiting long? It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for. You told a lie and got on a plane. That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am. Okay.  Good.  Goodbye. Becky? What? Is this crazy? No.  That's the weirdest part about it. Thank you.  I love you. I love you, too. Good night. Does this look familiar to you? It s my father s pin. He wore it everyday of his life. What? You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man. Don't get carried away. I find myself in dire need of some cash. I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere - Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just - What? What? Nothin'. What were you gonna say? Go ahead. I don't - Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead. Yeah? Yeah. Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out. Let me think about that. Okay. See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust. Mm-hm. You know? Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry. Hm. He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass. Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too. Increases? Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games? Well...no, of course not-- I want a child. Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude-- Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself. Huh... Is there a press conference today? What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ... Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle -- I won't. What happend to you? I got in trouble at school. Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik. Saavik... Is... David with you? Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance. This Vulcan -- is he alive? He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet. That was nice of Mr. Galbraith. He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him. I don't know any Rwandans. You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise. Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage... Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies. Where's egghead? His kid's sick. I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere. I never knew Hildy to be so determined before. You haven't seen anything yet. Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry... And? Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end. You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...? Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver. Yeah, right. No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell. Where are we? Someplace safe. How you feeling? Wipe 'em out? Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean. I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened. Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened! I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him! Here you go.  One champagne cocktail. Thank-Q! I thought only hookers drank those things. Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em! So I hear you're taking some time. Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit. Where're you going? I don't know. India maybe. Why there? Never been. If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States! And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German. Fook ya! Learn English, then! Fook ya dooble! How can I help you? Where would you like me to put my ash? Jack.  Jack. I didn't touch it. You've always had good taste in husbands, so... Thanks, thanks. Mh-hm. That's a beauty! Isn't that great? Oh! Go right over there. Football! She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that. Yeah, she said we looked queer. What's the plan? Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							* What's wrong? Security's locking down the elevators. I could see you were pining away-- Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday? Yes--I remember-- You don't want to go there. Why? Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends. It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies. Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off. If that's true, then why'd you save me? Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again. Unless they're in your Summer school class! Shut up! Uh oh... don't turn around... What? Why? Forget it... Why are you going here? What is here? My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home. Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother s death. Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir. You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing? I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait -- -- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight. Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement? I have. I have a copy for you. How do you do? Can't complain. I say NO! Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do... Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man. Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway. Why not? Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards. That's stupid. Why? People fart backwards. Do you think that's funny? Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years. Temperature's dropping. Yes. I guess you can't invite me in? No. People home. No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking. I'm a little cold. You're a little boy and you like to be bad. We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives. I'm too old for you. I'm too old for me. That's my predicament. Good night. We don't have anything from the Nurse Association? The broad has disappeared... The Hospital...? Firepower costs money. Anybody got any? How can you tell it's a female? ... The way she moves. Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night. I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night? Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things. Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to. You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him. It was a miracle. The man was ill or something. Forget Tonya Randall. I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me. Then prove her wrong. I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me. So you're gonna act salty all night? You know, I really wasn't expecting all this. Well...I guess they did get a little carried away. I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it. Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people. I'm sorry. Yes... Can you make it back? Oh my... I'll try. ...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from? ...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh? I have to take a shower. You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money. America has been good to me... Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you... They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn. What? Nothing.  Just...memories! It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak. Eh, could I have my pen back now, please? Oh, of course. What is your name? Harold Chasen. How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude. Nice to meet you. Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you? OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby. Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport. My jumbo jet? Smashing baby. You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless. But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love. You have insulted my son. Next time I'll cut off more than his finger. Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi. Your suit, Becky! Just get in yours! Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes? I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day. Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth. I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ... He's gotten involved -- Schnapps... Peppermint... alright. He said open it. Just sending a message.  She'll get the point. Excuse me? Get out You are throwing me out. Get out. What is it? We're hung up on something. Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife? Yes, Hi. Old woman! Man! Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there? I'm thirty-seven. What? Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor - Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available -- Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem. Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations. Right, I understand that... Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that. C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth. Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once. So now you suddenly care about my future? Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us. Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them. ...What do you mean, you decided not to park here? Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here. Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back! God I'm hungry. I can undress myself, thank you. All right. I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived. Bravo. Aw, you're tough. I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version. Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike. Who's left out there? Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood. Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners. I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes. Damn straight. You look better than ever. I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left. She seemed upset. What's wrong with your back? Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you? I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go? I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris. I saved your life. You shouldn't have. He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you. Who wouldn't. Is Billy going to be there tonight? He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night. Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe! May I have your ticket, please? Harry? Harry, where are you?! Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me? I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard. Calm down, Frances. Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter! String a few together.  All I need's eleven, How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off? What do you think would hold it off? Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding. I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me? I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why... Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean? Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh... Remember the Maine... That's from the ... it's got to be from the... Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too! ...uh ... No, that's... We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here. Jam has yet to do an overnight with us. I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it. Is it good? I don't know. It might be... Hi. Looks like things worked out tonight, huh? Yeah. I love you, Will.  No take-backs. What you got there, mate? A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance? Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating.. ..or hard wired.. - or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say. What the fuck? Brimmer! Could you come in here please? Story, honey? Why, what story? About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time. Kings! Why, honey, there was only one. I mind you said there was two. Well, shoot! Maybe there was! I see you're prospering without me. It's been a while. Where's the dog? That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st... I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over. Just go to the beginning! Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that? Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning? Yeah. It's really good. Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around. He says he's leaving the island sir. Don't let him do that. You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate... This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you... I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you? See, that's why you ain't getting recruited. Who said I'm not getting recruited? Your hot-ass temper. You've got a couple of hours, maybe. To do what? I can't answer that. What will they do to you? That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere? You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me. Are you out of your mind? You fucked up, Glen. Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here. Is it safe? Absolutely. It's his life insurance money, you know. What a good week. You mean nobody died? We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange? So why this ? Excuse me ? Why did you build this whole place ? Is this really the time ? Do you have something better to talk about ? I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me. He hired you to build this place ? I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships. At that point were you able to fight him off? No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go. Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance. What? She is not your birth mother, is she? No, but... why do you ask that? What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive? She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about? Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place. If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave? I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel. Hey, it's you. I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation. Appreciation for what? I don't know. For helping me out. Where did you get that thing? I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. Where the hell do you think you're going? Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock. Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here. I don't have much time. Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now. You don't really want to know. I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want? Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with. And? I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again. So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh? I guess you knew that, anyway. I suspected as much. You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago. Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me. Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl. What do you mean? I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia. When was this? Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now. Different? With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant? A trifle. Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it. When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her. And what had you done? Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all. Then what was it? Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends. Then why did she object to you? Because she was afraid. Afraid you'd take Mitch? Afraid I'd give Mitch. I don't understand. Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love. Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman. No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned. Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter. She already has a daughter. What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this? I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again. I see. So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished. Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay? You get straight to the point, don't you? I'm sorry. Forgive me. No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself. I did. Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason. And the second? I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever. Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south. You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes. Moon's too bright. Who's that? That's me, Merv. Oh Jesus! LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me! At least he doesn't have a beard.... Do you enjoy dealing blackjack? Major, Major... he's here ... Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too. You believe that? No. You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have. You believe that? I believe that? Yes, I believe that. You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens? Yes. Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone! Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source! I don't think you really understand -- No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism! I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words! Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action. All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about? It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him. So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh? More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good. What's your name? Palm Apodaca. Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put. It could blow over tomorrow, too. I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb. That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three. The youngest applicant by eight years. You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division? I was thinking Detective Bureau. That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again? No.  What am I to do? The only thing you can do.  You must end it. The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us. What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away. Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence... Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing. Really? Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room. Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium? I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them. I think I'd probably like the apple business. You're a little overqualified, aren't you? No, I'm not. I need a job. The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring. ...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker. Elvis? Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri. Jesus.  Two in one night? Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there. Pick me up in five minutes. Don Tommassino. Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa. Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen. You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo. I know. Where are you going? Corleone. There is nothing there.  Not anymore. I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old. Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America. Don Tommassino...I should see this place. Four! What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots? But what if you need more money? I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye. Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty.. What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember? I think you added the "brutal. Forget it. Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside. Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?! SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT... Okay, that's it. You're going back to -- What do you think you should have done? Thank you, 'Mam. Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect? I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun. I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me -- -- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show -- I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly -- FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did -- I paid you back. Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest -- Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming -- Look, that's back when I hated you. I remember every minute of that party. There's my dad with Joanie. I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch? No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her! I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play. Nothing just yet Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu. Maneuvering thrusters, sir. Hold station. Thrusters at station-keeping, sir. Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell. Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect. No blood on the knife. Time? Between six and seven seconds. The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film. Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November? It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public. The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it. That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it. Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot? It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the... ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff... Stop, we're embarrassing h... ... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes... There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you. I cannot-- --Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it. Donny got shot ... A jacker ... How is he -- ? They got him to the hospital. He's stable ... Is there anything else? I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help. I've already got more help than I need. I think you need more help than you've got. You want me to take you somewhere? Long as it's fun. Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me! Oh, Lotte... We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills? Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you? Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim? I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like. Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind? Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition? I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for... ... an offlander? For someone so young. ....I didn't realize I said it out loud. Said what? I'm an orphan. Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment.... Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest? I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks. Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those. Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door? Alfredo, did you know my father? Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable. And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar. At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship... So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- -- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it. You think it'll send this guy back to hell? Correct, And that's when -- Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy". I can't do it. You positive about that? It's a different kind of deal. Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming? It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable. And then we're gonna do her right here. Right? You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore. Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building. I shouldn't be at all surprised. Are you the son of Vito Corleone? Yes. Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud... Exactly... There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me. I'm not sewing anything else. You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk. No! Hana, I know you do! I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford. Come on. Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything. Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in. Not likely!  Where are the speeders? We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ... We'll have to go out on Tauntauns. The temperature is dropping too fast. You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it. Elaine -- are you serious about this? I'll think about it. You really will? Yes. No!  Stop -- I will need you all.  All for one. One for all. You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him! You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you. I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much. You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them. Stay with him. Wait! There's no time to discuss it! You want a Dairy Queen? No way. I'm about to blow up. You what? To save me? Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you? Go through with what? Suicide. Please, come, Holiness. Yes. I am ready. He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man. Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock. Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and... And what, Sergeant? I don't rightly know, sir. That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day. What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George? I don't know. George! Are you mad at me? Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother. Eddie, is it all right if I get personal? Whaddya been so far? Eddie, you're a born loser. What's that supposed to mean? First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off. I told you. I got drunk. Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers. Thanks for the drink. Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you. To do what? Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again. Why? Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me. Oh yeah, I figured that. How much? Seventy-five per cent. For who? For me. That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors? How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win. You think I can lose? I never saw you do anything else. You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars. Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way. Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles. I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent. Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk. No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it. Kiss off. What happened? He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus. What about the tapes? We found the originals. The originals? There was a transfer. Am I to understand-- He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact. Who? Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir? Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him <u>now</u>. That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo? He's thirty-five years old. You're a great architect, Albert. Thank you. Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  -- Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse. I rode here, on my horse. Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses. What if the Japanese did invade? We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago. MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM! Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now?? You sent for me, sir? Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help. Splendid! Is he sick? No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift. Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now? You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey. Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission    I mean    might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir    and people are beginning to talk. What's that book you've got there? The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings. Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. I don't remember her as having brown eyes. Benjamin? Yes? Will you unzip my dress? It's so cold. I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back. Don't leave me! I'm just going to find things for the fire. That's not Maurice? That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone. With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment? We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community! If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress. Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards. I just want her to be happy. Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body. Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you? I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up... Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me! Turn around.  Hands on your head! What the hell's going on? Who are you?  What are you doing out here? I'm... I'm just delivering a package. Would you look at that? My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs... Looks like he missed ya. Yeh, this time anyway. Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander? Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee? You're welcome to one. No thanks. The men would like to know who this gentleman is. That's none of their affair. This is day care.  It s where babies go when their parents are at work. Check... Did you read the latest draft, by the way? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And? I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something. How about the new ending? Did you like that? Oh yeah. Much better. There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same. Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different. You okay? Yeah, just a nick ... Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us? No thanks.  Sounds good though. Suit yourself. Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything? Some money. And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental. Wow! I mean it Ted, you're running this one. Object to the form of the question! It acts as a drug on the body? Object to the form! It acts as a... Object! There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug? Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here... Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr... Can't make you change your mind? Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head. Might be different in New York. Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out. I'd like that. 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies. 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45. Did he, now? If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list. Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it. Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful. Mmm. My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone! Poor Cathy -- Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it. Is that the manager? Unlock that door.  Check the aisles. Cal... Annie...got an umbrella...? Nope. I'll walk you home, you can have my coat. She's dead. Noooo! Noooo!!! Yes? Puffed cheese? No thank you. I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with-- Do I look like I want a tiny pizza? No. Then let's assume I don't. Yes sir. Yes. Where do you live? Excuse me. Where do you live? I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else? Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double. Oh God, Lins... I-- Tell me later. What? Are you glad?  I'm glad. Oh no.  I smell it. Keep the animal quiet. Do you know what he's talking about? I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first. He's doing well today. I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did. He's kind of a miracle. Yes he is. All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way? The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe. Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights. The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed? Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure? Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven. Hmm.  Let's aim higher. My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel. My pleasure, sir. Please forgive me for keeping you waiting. Apology accepted. Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name. Colonel will do. As you wish. So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military? I am not permitted to speak of such things. Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are. So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking. The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office. A little basic, but nice. I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here. Where are you going? I don't know. When are you going to be back? I don't know. Well, until you know, you can't go. Oh, okay. No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead. This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division. I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell    Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy! No... Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults? I've had a gutful of this. If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody. Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. Oh yeah? Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. Jeffrey!! Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment? Yeah. Jeffrey?. Why? I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret. You like mysteries that much? Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much. Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  * Why would I have a gun? I'm going to the powder room. Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons. Pay money? Yeah, dummy.  Money. I never paid for it in my life. It's better when you pay... they let you do anything. They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life. Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me? Traitor! She'll marry you in hell! He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you! I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH. GOT 'EM. What happened? Three times.  Powerful number. Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>. As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler? Why  You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend -- I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us? You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital. Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies? It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand? Yes but, we were wondering- There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it? Oh.  I... where's Louise? She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend. That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely. Did you have a nice Christmas? Lovely. You were a big help. Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party. I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor -- But I thought you could hold your tongue. It won't happen again. You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go. You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by. I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can. Yes, Mr. Sheldrake. Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about? The Matrix? Do you want to know what it is? By the way -- it's you. Me? Yes.  What do you think? Well, yes.  Groovy. Does Bella come here? That bitch? No. Marge? Where are you going? I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra. The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize. Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three. Human? Tell me not to worry, John. Don't worry, Lamar. The nation votes this week... That's impossible.  Insects don't... I know.  Help me get a sample. Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche? Va jouer, mon ange. You know - we do have enough money. Especially now. Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that? I'm trying to help, Duff. Yeah! I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway. What the hell could you do? Day work. You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street. We've come all this way for a rock wall?! There should be a way to open it. What'd you say to him? To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know. What does Norman already know? Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake. Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova. You need some work, buddy! You stayin' in or not? I'm in. It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it. Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again! What is Terrance and Phillip? Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children! Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'. Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing. He was just here! He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine. Everything is not fine! Are you busy tomorrow night? No. Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay? Sure. You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here. We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call. Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours. I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max. Oh, I'll represent alright. How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope. A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab. Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee. Are--are you crying, Penelope? She's crying because she's so happy. What happened... ? Don't ask. Special Agent? You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig. Wanna play? No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me. Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me... You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister. And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you. Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for. I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life. Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!! Okay. "Dance Music For Old People? Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them. And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards? Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape? Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home. Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes. Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know. Not by the thousands. No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something. Yes, but the curtains were drawn. Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing. What are we going to do about it, Al? I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what? Well...  Well... these birds attacked us. Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies! I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do? Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father. Does it float? We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs. Where's Craig? I don't know. Jesus, man, can you change the station? Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab! I've had a-- I pull over and kick your ass out, man! --had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man-- That's it!  Outta this fucking cab! So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance? Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No. Well, then, w-who was? Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School. You haven't once said you like my dress. I like your dress.  It's very bright. You fellas got names? Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there. Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax. You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out. But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic? Billy and his penis don't deserve you. That was uncalled-for. I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink? Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on. What were you saying, Governor? Sorry. I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate! I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in.... What's that....? Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright. I wouldn't go so far as to say that. There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean? No. I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it? Maybe it's because I live here. That must be it. It's a great smell. Really? Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright. But if I don't plug it in how can I... Never mind the plug, just go through the motions. But then how can you... I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect. Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics. Just an observer. ...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told. Told what? I, uh... thanks. It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives. A factor of age. I hope I never get that old. You won't. Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him ! Yahoo !!!!! That's the price, my brother. Yo, I don't have that kind of cash. For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash. How long you gonna be here? Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party. You're gonna be at John K's party? My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh. Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right? The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning. Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there? I'll see you there. ... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service? I don't know. Few munce. Ya find the work interesting, do ya? ...What're you talking about? You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack? Twenty-eight years, Frank. Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why? If you want to tell me. What did you do to the batteries? Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he? Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere! Oh, that's nice. What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor? As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch.... Two days. And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about... They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that? No... I guess not. What is your job title, exactly? Excuse me? I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy? I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am. Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know. What are you talking about? You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there? Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?! How the fuck should I know!! I sure hope this isn't permanent. Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport -- I...don't think so. I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face. What happened? I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was. Hey, you! Let me guess. Amy presumed I d forget the rings.  I think I m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry. Maybe not her least... There s always-- Okay, young lady, that's it. Like I give a fuck. The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding? Nothing. Where are the stockings he strangled them with? How did you know they were stockings? I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot. What happened? There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken. The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so. Did you bring me here to sup? Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron. What weapon? Sunlight. Plan on carrying some away in a kettle? Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates. Hi-iii... Hi.  Where've you been? Sightseeing...  What're you doing? Packing. Why? Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase. So, you've had a little bad luck. A little bad luck? Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up. Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers. You are like  Pop! What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...? Like pick up some booze and go to a motel? Or we could do that yeah. This isn't happening. Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer. -- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue. Do you still have it? No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you. So... what do you have to tell me? Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you? What is it. Tammy? I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters. Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word. I did it. And when did you do it? This weekend. Exactly when? I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday. And how did you get in the school? Door was open. Which door? I don't know. All I know is I did it I I don't believe you. I have proof. The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made. My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why. However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you. I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours. You lied. Where is your tribe? My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system. Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'? What about it? A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured? I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira. Certainly not.	You're a mutant. That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor. Of course. All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic? Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon -- Then you admit -- I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women? Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started? You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone? I don't know. If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity. I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done? You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards! Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with? We were just talking about him. Let me go, let me go, you creeps... Everybody okay up here? If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald? Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange. Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it? Me first? Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help? How could it not? Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist. Come on now.  People are smart. No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that. It's about the leopard. You're worrying about its killing someone else? Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody. Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position. You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back? No. I'm quite sure. How long have you lived here? Two years. There's nothing on the walls. No pictures-- Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on. Like your story is over. I've felt that way, yeah. Do you have any music? What? Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked. John, play the Sinatra. How is he? Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right. ... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark. ... Okay. Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for. Madam, in happy time what day is that? Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride. What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride! Here comes your father, tell him so yourself. You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records? So? Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files. Lucky break! Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up. Did you see anything in the files? It was all in Czech wasn't it. What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them? Yeah, somewhere? Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there. Do you want me to see what's on them? No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here. And if you're wrong. Siberia. What do you want me to do? Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone? Yeah, Dave Walters. Good, what's his number? I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is. It's on the table, Dad. Done! Let's move out! Prints? Nothing so far. What about the ballistics report? Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it. Not quite how I imagined it -- -- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself? There was no other way. I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back. Me too. Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name? You know, I... don't know. Is she here tonight? She can't watch herself. This is private property.  This is breaking and entering! Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute. Yeah...? Sonny...? Yeah. Where's Riccardo? On the phone. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny... Thanks. See man? You know? I remember coming here with my parents. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry. That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry. Never got to wear one of those. Please come, please. W... I can't wait for you to meet her! Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it? I guess so.  You're a doctor? Here they are--I got them. They are all right. Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator. What about dinner? Dinner can wait. Is, uh... Is he okay? He will be... When he can't write, he drinks. No, that's not him... Positively not! Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us -- Something good -- Who... who are you...? I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one... I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again. I'm... Done? Yeah, thanks. No problem. ... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you. Any luck on the grant money? Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there... And? I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started... I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted. Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam. Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again. Buffy, what are you doing here? I thought we were meeting here. I'm here with Jenny. This is neither the time nor the place -- If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails -- I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use. What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time! It just didn't fit her profile... Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!! She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her... ...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind... ...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a... I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the... Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon-- Come on in. Big enough? Fine. Corkscrew's on the right. Then why the sudden exit without even telling me? Do you want the truth, Anya? It would be a nice change from you. I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious. You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice-- How'd you ever get away with it? When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me. Sure! I never want to go back.... Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean? She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore. That's your problem, Miles. As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place. Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages. It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free. Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy. Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK? Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling. Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal. Italian? I'm sorry. Italian. Who? Not who, food.  Should we get Italian. Sure. ...four years ago... Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello... I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette... It's not broken. What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it? Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all. You said nobody would miss her. No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel. Oh, Mr. Den-n-by! Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary? I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup? All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup? When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute? Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left-- I didn't mean to hurt you. Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. You what? You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease. There's no disease, I can tell you. Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you? I'm glad you do. There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death. Dorothy. No! If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. You called me Jeffrey. I did. Are you? Yes. Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK. No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright. I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain. Interrogation's over, Bedsoe. What? Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy. You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared. It's circumstantial. I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort. Yes, I will. Stop it!  What are you doing? Nothing... just taking his teeth. But you can't just kill a man for his teeth! Why not?  He has good teeth... Because... because you just can't! -- You can't go in there! -- We have to talk to her, Viktor! Quite a collection. If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass. Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song. You said. Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm... No.  I'm quite certain you can't. Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help. We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter. Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick. Hello Ugarte. Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats. Oh, of course. Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot. I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble. We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet. A what? It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away. But they'd still get the idea, right? You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you? It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work. Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast. Before they kill somebody else, too. Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions. You mean -- break in? I don't know -- And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished. Y'know my lady Lucindy? The one with da big... Not her, the one with the little... Oh her. Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a... You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool. Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie? What? You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell. It does. It must be oxygenated if we can hear him. Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through. They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo. Did they take your clothes? No. You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em? No. Usually they take clothes. Why don't you give 'em a call. What about jewelry? They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender. The blender? I love my blender. They didn't take the silverware? No, but they took my blender. Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric? What? They only took electrical appliances. Serve the ball. So? Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional... You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute - Susan, it seems to me - Don't tell me you're sorry. I'm not sorry. I'm going to leave you. No, you're not. Yes. Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct. The real story on Miss Carpenter. All the gory details. It's about me and David. The perfect couple, I should say. You mustn't take it so badly. Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type. Don't you ever stop? No. Hello, Louis. How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce. A lot? Enough. Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying? Yes, of course, Dr. Lester. Oh, be still my heart. Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom? With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know. Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes. We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five. Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding! And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John. At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I - I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements. What are you doing with all these blueprints? Some buildings I'm working on. Are you... an architect? Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card. Not have it. No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way? Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance. No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady. Beautiful. Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea -- A bad idea. I got us through the War all right. And almost got hanged in peacetime. That's it. He walked eighteen?! It's a league record. Struck out eighteen... League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit. So says her website. She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico-- Status report, Admiral! Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized. Neutralized?" How? We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand... Can you protect us? We are launching everything we have. Pollution? Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing. I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done. I want to thank you for what you've done. Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway. Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip! Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes. I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know. Now mount up, son... WHAT DID YOU SAY? I... I didn't say anything... This must be business, there's nothing else here. Follow it. Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life. Yes, my lord. They? Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick. What else could I do? Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh? Lois, someday -- Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me. I like worrying about you. I aimed high. We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you. Get out of here. It's really that bad? I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross. What is it? An obituary column... can you read in this light? Yes... I think I can manage... Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why? Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself. What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave. The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago. We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing. Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find. That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom? I guess it depends on what you give up on. Oh! Now do you believe me! Where is he? Tranq guns down, rifles up! What do you see? Riddick? Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger. Uh... it's the end of October. Is that soon? nothing. I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing. I won't.  I'm a lesbian. I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself. Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you. I promise I'll make more time for Jasper. Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you. Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz. I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed. Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see? I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through? That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me. Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back! Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV! What about the kids? They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you. Heidi, I'm dying. I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river. Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?! See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home... That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him. That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this. The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee. Thanks. I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time. Fair enough. Well, I tried. I understand, mister. It means something, really. Can I see you again? That's not hard to do. No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do. Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow. Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a... We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising. Fund-raising?? We think you'd be good at it. You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it! No-no-no... I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night? No.  No, you go ahead. You sure you'll be okay? I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend. I'll be back before you leave. Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears. I see you read the book. Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock. And an explanation is, of course, out of the question. Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself. Oh Dewey, I'm sorry. No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be. But I thought you'd be cool if... I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one! A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father. But you're old! I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here? I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life. This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you? Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me? That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore. Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying. Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want. DELETE IN CUTTING And I will lead. Nice!  Nice little balance to it. Ja, ja. Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane. Thank you sir! Thank you! What the fuck -- ? Paraffin. What? Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought. But Catholicism?  Why not your own people? Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ? I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try. But why?  We raised you as a Jew. So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision. The  1,000 is on account. My rates... We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention. Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz? Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate. She'd be about thirteen now... We got two around that age... Where? You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column... But couldn't you...? Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there! He tried to borrow money from us. What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear. He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach. It's on an island that no one get to. But he has been there, off course. It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning. Besides, we don't know the city and-- Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go! Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende? Sorry... Habit. Carlo! He's in the bathroom. Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce. She did ? She wants me to arrange the financial settlement. Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast. You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you. Sure have. I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes. I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ... I know! Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he? He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron. You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur? Jacques! Alvy, now don't panic. Please. Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house. Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There. Son of a bitch! Calm down, Bud. Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything. Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving? Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs? Hey, don't run away now. Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell. Damn it!  How long to fix? Goddamn Sam! And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966. Should I? Wait. What's that mean? It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water. I wasn't going to try anything. Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette. Actually, that's my stage name. I'm sorry? Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche. Blanche. No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer. Well, that's fine -- But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up. Right. And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career. Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us? Candy Man.'  Is that all right? It's one of Jack's favorites. You live here. I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth. Why am I here, Mr. Hadden? The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal. What kind of deal? The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in. I didn't realize I was out. Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it. You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden? I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much. If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you. That's my girl...  Lights. Something like what... Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it. The Fidelity nonsense... All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me. They re not my attack dogs. What do you mean? I just fired Bob Alexander. Someone is playing with you. Why? I don't know. It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer. Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest! We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko. Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott? We're ready, sir. Thank you, Scotty. Stand by. You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you? Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful --- Many people thought her beautiful. I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it? In this barracks? Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest. Who is it? That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do? Who is it? Get in there ! This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party. Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river. Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway. I will, I promise. Hildy, I thought you were gone -- Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could. Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear. The US Army:  Always an adventure. Let me see the map. The door was open. I don't know what I'm doing. I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it. First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear. Vasquez, take point.  Let's move. That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it? You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted? Exactly. You have it. Oh, no. I'm watching my figure. No way. Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant. This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me? Certainly. Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind. I won't. Thank you. I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever! That's my girl! Are you leaving us? Oh no.  We'll always be together. Smooth move, hot-shot. What was I supposed to do? What? I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think? What? Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain! I know the code. If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete. It would appear, so do you. Thirty-two and change. Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up. I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you. Arlyn Page. Did she and Jane McKenna know each other? Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time. Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too. Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her. You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars. I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds? Don't worry. Strange... I can feel my old self coming back... Mmmm -- so can I... But he didn't say anything. Hang on a second. No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want -- <u>Full power damn you</u>! What happened? I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn. Who? My father and the Baron. Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait! I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I... They tricked you. My own father... How bad was the unicorn's wound? It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away. He did run? Oh, yes, and the mare with him. Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn. ...ting the ruby slippers? The slippers -- yes.....the slippers! Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you? No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise. I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that... Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay. A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney? And where is it now? In his office.  I saw it this morning. Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow? Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy. I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?! Shall I leave, M'lord? If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him. Er. well, nowhere special. I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon. Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up. What are you doing? My job. Back off, Benedict. You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie? Hello? Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet. Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care. They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half. That's what I hear. Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious. Who's "we"? Just some of the women. Why? I just wondered. Just wondered what? Why. Why what? Why you have to go out there. I don't have to. I want to. Is it the money? Eighty percent of it will go for taxes. Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater- The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere. I just asked a simple question. And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin... He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist. Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do? I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him. There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes! Yes.  We can pray. Good idea... Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously. Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports. Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum. Uhm... fine work. Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy. You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms... Cindy, what's going on? It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him! Hello, remember me? Hell yeah, I remember you. I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes. It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys. I just wanted to give you this. You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private. Yes. Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph, Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait. I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello. I think your boss is going to need some spin control. I quit two days ago, Brian. What'll you do? I don't have the slightest idea... I'll see ya around, huh? It's a small town. Why is he in the basement? He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left. Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get? What's to see? What's on the ClockCam? Shhhhhhh! What?! It's ok.  Everything's under control. You're pawning The Rock?! Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica. Now you're starting to sound like a victim again. You could've hit me. Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts. You wouldn't -- Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish -- Stop talking like that! Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me! It smelled of the fire. It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way. Really? Tell me about it. It's an uprising. Of birds? Certainly, of birds. Haven't you heard what I said? I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured! I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now! You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say. No! You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star! Mama, shut up! And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?! You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would. It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean. It's very interesting. Oh, look! The birds. Well that's what he said. What else? He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures. Take my advice grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony. I didn't ask for your advice. That's right. You didn't. You're not going to notify my father, are you? What for? If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. I never thought of that. Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York. Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me. We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'. George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might. Not that it matters.  This is the morgue? You up to it now? Sure. Let's get it over. One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound... Yes, I know, I know. Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun. What? I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here. Ate the gun. Oh. Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock. Well, let's get the shock over with. You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that. Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I? You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games. Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody. You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny. Yeah. That's funny. Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden. Howdy. Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks. Commander, I have to log it... That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing! What do you think of the strike, Ali? I think it'll be a success ... Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do? Sixteen. And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year... I like my name. This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married. Are you here to take Shelly back? Is that the one who died? Gabe. -- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us. You ever been to London? Only in the movies. I've 'ardly ever left it. Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen. I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right. Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes. ...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake... Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on. ...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself... You saved my life. Did you think I could just leave you...? Hang you like the witch you are, unless-- --Nick!! There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say. Good. How big is the sub-basement? Apparently it's huge. I think I should come with you. We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight. I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'? Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself? There's a way to get a guy's attention. My mission in life. What are you thinking about? By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you. Really? Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy. What'd you say we're supposed to be doing? Hitch-hiking. Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking  Baseball? I believe somebody owes me ten dollars -- You made me look like an idiot -- Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy. He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question. You don't know where Loretta is? No idea. Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk. Okay, I'll tell her. Don't try to talk -- Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back. No, we can treat the wounds -- ...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it. No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there. Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again. Hah. Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder. When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans... It will be. What we really need is some red meat in here for bait. No, sir! We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people. Hey, what are you doing?! I know a short-cut. Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves? Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends. The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell. The police station. He'll be pulp by now. Honey, Church will be fine. But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary? Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight. Where are you going? It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on. A new invention? Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me. We were planning to be married right after Christmas. Oh, I'll be back before Christmas. It's a promise? That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting. I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout. I know! You helped me go from a six to a four! The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner? We will, but first I have a surprise. A surprise? The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about. Fuck is up?! Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? Thank you, Thomas. For what? We started without you. Good. You see the paper? I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot. His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie... Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him. Well of all- Margo! Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies! Wilbur, he picked them for us himself... You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples? I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell. That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor. I'll do the same for you sometime. Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor? What octopus motor? You know, to make the legs move -- Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling! What was <u>that</u>? <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife. The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you? Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife. I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate. Maroon, right? Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again. What the hell would they want with a gag factory? Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs. Now is that clear? Yes sir. I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you... Men, huh? She spoke to me. To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say? She said... Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops? No. Sugarballs? No. What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy. I have a cinnamon bar. You do? You can have half. You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson! I try... The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me. Good thing. How is he? He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat. How much time does he have left? You don't talk about those things. Not yet. He is not going to kill the old man? No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black. Goodbye, Paul. Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division. You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser. No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser. My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you. Sure. And hurry, they're not looking too happy. Then how come it worked loose? I have no idea. Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please. As you wish. Goodbye, Muffin. No, you're the muffin. I LOVE YOU. Yeah Kay, I'm here. Can you say it? Huh? Tell me you love me. I don't believe it. I'm winning. Don't get cocky, girl. Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them. They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes. I knew there was a sound explanation. Mr. Clear Moon. Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here. Save it. Sure, Hicks. Are there snakes out here? They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em. Doesn't the isolation bother you? Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way. You love him? No. Did you ever? Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me. Is that why you're with him? I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love? I'm guessing no. Yeah, I guess you're right. I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned. I'm still here, aren't I?  See this? The Jolly Nigger Bank. This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century. Thanks. I thought it was appropiate. Is that good or bad? It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles. How so? To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human. I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me! Penny--?!  Are you all right? As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing. I do not think I like the sound of that. It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be. I feel hardly nothing. You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned. But why be so concerned about me? This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more. And you? I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something. I am not ready for this. You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them. Of course. You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love. That is not me. With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one. We'll let you know tomorrow. Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go. Thanks for coming by. We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house. We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up. I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi. How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"... What's the rush? I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women... You see it? Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in. This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade? ... What's happening to him? Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate! But she told him, Frances. She told him about us. I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her. They are beautiful. Yes, they are. You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one. But... It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have. I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby. You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now. Harry!  Where are you! In the helicopter. A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this. I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who. Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did. I know how he feels. Yeah? Oh yes, always. Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit. I knew that. ...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station. Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please? Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog? Oh my God, Steven. Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head. I'm now begging you. Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki. What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water... You can't fight'em that way... You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!? Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker. Put it on speakers. You're two hours late. I know.  It's her fault. Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank. I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do. A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it? Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion. Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on. I'll get it, Jabez. Thanks, Mary. Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it. Have you tried it with a little cinnamon? I ain't trying to rob you... Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach? Man, Day-Day is my people! I said shut up!  Now who sent you? Nobody! If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing! I'll be gone two or three weeks. You'll be gone, period. No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son. The same, your Majesty. Oh, shit. Someone pop your balloon? No problem, no problem. M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko. What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together... Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline. If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic. Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him? Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch. Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went? To know where that leopard went -   I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh water college back East. I gave that up. Piss off! Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It s important. I was building a doggy door. God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?! You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay. I just want to watch it, okay? What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis -- I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis. We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group. We're very evolved. Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker. Thank you. Would you like the same suite? Definitely. The gang's all here! Keep 'em busy. As long as it's not 'what's your sign? If you could meet God, what would you say to him? That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads. The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things. What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing... No, it's not that simple, Dave... Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is? What? Starting up. What hard part? Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is? What? Just the act. What act? Do you want to talk about it. I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me. No.  I mean your relationship. We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore. Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change. People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own. Not if the people change together in relation to that love. Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged. Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love. I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time. ...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...? Main Street. Doug, the traffic light... <u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture... ... Luke, you must not go. But Han and Leia will surely die. You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate. I can help them! You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn. I feel The Force. But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side. What's that for? Luck. This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell? He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General-- How is he? Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right. ... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark. ... Okay. Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry. You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America! Ow! But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence? I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess. Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan? If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life. You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind. That's what I get for dressing in a hurry. Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready? I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation -- Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg... He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son? How did he expect to do that? An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me. Good morning! What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good? All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened? Objection! I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced? Bring her home... I guess. No more violence... No more violence... I'm right behind you, Blue Leader. What's that? Oh shit... Fuck factor ten. C'mon on, this way. I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run! Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ... In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward. Yes. Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor. Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s... I'll mail you a letter, come on! There's two of 'em, Lou! Yah? Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy. Oh, yah? What you doin'? Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that! Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you? There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it? -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit -- -- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean? Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter! A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master? That's it?  No number, or instructions? Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it... Can I help you, sir! What? Oh -- no -- I'm just -- You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want? You can? You love me now, don't you? Very much. I solemnly swear... By the sacred memory... By the sacred memory... Of Siegfried... Of Siegfried... Wagner... Wagner... Nietzche... Nietzche... Bismark... Bismark... They're making "Blair Witch II," too. No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone. <u>What</u>? Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today-- Now, don't get into any trouble. Take care. Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall. I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there. Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid. Come on...put his head in place. Kate, is something the matter? Larry brought me flowers last night. Is that bad?... I think he's having an affair. How's the weather down there? Mr. Henry? Come on in! It's locked. No, it's not. You're not. Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was... That's good. And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit. Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you. I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet? You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent. But I hate cops, remember? Except for her. Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys. Who says you're the good guys? God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself? Difficult.  I'm difficult. Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play. Leave her alone. Get up. You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson! I try... Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'. Why? Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore. C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve. That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it. What? Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep. It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark. Where did you see it? Behind me.  Over there. Do you really think I'm mad? Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak. I'm okay ... I'm okay ... You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ... I'm not going.  I'm okay. I'm starving...somebody, help. Got a half a tuna sandwich. Same one you had yesterday? Very instructive But who was the Devil? Police are coming. That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy. You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you? I don't gamble. I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them! Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm. Hey. Hey. How'd it go? I'm here, aren't I? She...killed Burke Dennings. What? She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window. Our resignations. You going rogue on me? Maybe. What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played. You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe? There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister. Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something. Sure, what is it? Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying. What's up? It's about my salary cheques. Yes? Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left. No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice. Something good? Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something. I don't want to hear anymore. You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong. Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad? Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...? There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian. He was? Yes.  He admitted it. Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper. Why not? You know how they are... sex... Then just say he was sixty years old. Is that what it means? Of course. Oh yeah. Fine. Thanks a lot, Ted. Where's Shorty? I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago. ..this week's TKE kegger... Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece. We've set you each at a five dollar quota. Jack? We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit. So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans. Her phone's probably tapped. And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel. Shit. Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you. It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together. Who's going with you? You're looking at him. Where's the rest of the team? Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares. You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere -- -- This play means a lot to me. This play -- ? -- I know you don't suck at acting. No. Talking about it as a... No. As a robbery. As a "robbery"?!  No. Well.  Well... Hey. What's going on? We're under attack. Where's my family? We're handling it, sir. You're married? Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm. What are these, beauty marks? Those are ancient history. Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand? Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max. Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you? Fuck off. Hi. You watching the ballgame? Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep. Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then. Yeah... Are you having fun? Yeah. Definitely. Anyone skim the pool? It needs it. Harry -  I'm going. --it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this-- --there's nothing new in it-- --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it-- There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass. I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut. You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you? Well, uh... You did!! Look, can we discuss this later? I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers. Will you take it easy! Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!! I came here to save you. Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?? Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers! Oh, a *boy*! What is it?! You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended. So I did! And what was so important about it? Scotland. He intends -- I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail. Less ten percent. Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note. Professor Scott, if you'll -- I demand to see the owners! I demand -- What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein. Yo, Benny. Check the eyes, Ben. Where'd you come from? I've been here. You were lookin, right at me. I was? Yeah. I saw thum! I saw thum! Me, too! Me, too! To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together. I'll drink to that. Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you? I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" -- Dad stop it! Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it. Well... is it loaded? I tell you "officer", it wasn't... Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name? Sulu Hikaru. Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life. Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir. That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy. I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know... You know? Yeah. Do me a favor. Sure. What is it? Hit me in the face. You want me to do what? You heard me, I said hit me. C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks. Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw. Jack, I got no gloves. Here's your glove. Did I say that? You toler -- yes, tolerate me. Are we getting married? The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings. Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist. I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in. Do you think they bought it? Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them. You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit. All he needed was a reasonable explanation. Major, those are my boys out there dying. Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir? Good things... What are you sure about? Allow me. Thanks. Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake. The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it. Did you receive the letter? We did not. We must obey our emperor and the Senate. I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans. H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it! Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots. You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh -- I have other means of sustenance. The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come. But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins. No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea? There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive. You mean they ate each other up? They had to, in order to survive. What's wrong with this one? He ain't got five kids to feed. ...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service? Uh... not really. Yes? I... have come to communicate with my User. Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ... That's a terrible idea- -is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know. Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that? I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now. I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived. Then we agree. Nothing. Still nothing. It's been months. It's not like him. Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg. So have I I should go. I should leave today. Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors. And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor. Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease. By the way, how's he doing? He's dead. Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that. No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick. Big butt... you know, can't fly coach. I can't believe you. Me? You have to go in.  You have to get the leads. Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here. There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair... Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess. Yes John! These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat. How many shots you say you heard? Four to six. That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say. ...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination. No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it? We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear? I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital. It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him. It was an accident.  I'm not liable. Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later. We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman. Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS... Behave... Foreign devil ... Hello. Ambassador Han. Yes. Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying. What is that? It's frogs.  It's raining frogs. ...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs? It's raining frogs from the sky. ....what the fuck, what the fuck.... This happens....this is something that happens. What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? Manual or automatic? Automatic. You got it. Ready? What are you saying? What...is...it? Where are you going? I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes. Patrick? What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you. And just where are you from? Italy! What about the legalities of this...? Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights. We don't let go, you s... It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point. Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down. Is there a problem, gentlemen? I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point. Are you threatening me? It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice. Aw, please Junebug? No way. No, I definitely don't want to know. We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it. I say let's keep it the way it is. They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow. Still got a sense of humour? Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric? Can't say I do. A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face. We must sue for peace. Peace?! We cannot defeat this -- With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen! It is suicide. I don't even know you. You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody. Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down. He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink? That's like your car, Beverly, I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey. Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side. And got well paid for it on both occasions. The winning side would have paid you much better. Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here. I have my orders. Oh, I see. Gestapo spank. Ed, I'm so happy for you. Let's get married. Huh?! <u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas! But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck! So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise. One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary. We're losing the war, aren't we. It kind of looks that way. Pistols? Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful. You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing? I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait -- -- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight. It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks. Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can. Yes, Master! Act casual! What s going on? I m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It s a box marked  Jack.   I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army... Paris? Christ, you scared the shit out of me. Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet. Is your brother ready to go? Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on. He left! Yeah, come on. Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal. Well, that does sound very odd. You can't believe how much he's improved. How many times have you shocked him tonight? Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours. What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator? That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it? A medical miracle. Can you believe she fuckin' bit me? And she got the medium. Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra. They are beautiful. Yes, they are. You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one. But... It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have. I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby. You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now. Good morning. Mornin'. My name is Whale.  This is my house. Nice place. And your name is --? Boone.  Clayton Boone. I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean? Just that I was in the Marines. The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea. Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person. I'm a gracious host. I say we throw the switch and see what happens. Don't be an idiot. So. Do you have a name? It's Esther. From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath. How came you by this blade? I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it. Boys, boys... Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them! Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either. How old is he? Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you. I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash. I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody. Well, you're the lawyer. That ain't no happy child. He tortures toys -- just for fun. Hey, partner.  Grab a cup. I got to write my report first. Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses! Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river! Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day. What is it? A tranquilizer? A stimulant. Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now! Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field. Depression? Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce. Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist? Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks. And those lies she's been telling? Lies? Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff. Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities? Never. Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter- Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil. You're kidding! Like what? Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive. Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance! Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... Fine. What do you want on it? You. Would you settle for pepperoni? If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower. You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small? That's a suitcase? A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough. I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun. Yeah, I read the report... Goodbye. Bye! Excuse me? Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room? He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here. I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood? What's going on?! They've started the battle without me! Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you? No, it's not the cut that's bothering me. Would you like some brandy? If you have some, I'd... I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt? Break it off! How much more do we have to take from him? There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief. Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination? That's enough. I'm not-- A world of pain. Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation... Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet. Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy? Galley proof. Galley what? Page proof of a book I'm working on. How about that. Well, you always were a screwball. Oh, yeah? I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff? Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me. Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him? That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet. Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place. Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about. Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you. I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you. Open the door.  Please. Why don't you shoot off the lock? No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated. I know what you mean. That's why I stopped. But my sleeping is really fucked up. I don't think I've slept in a year. You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance. yeah? I'll give you a couple. See what you think. Okay. Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova? I love her. Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store. I think she's great. Me too. There's this poem -- Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house? I think, before. Seems too coincidental that way. Yeah, maybe. But we took the keys? Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John! Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!? You know your history. I know my treasure. I thought you'd be up with the sun. My stupid back. Me? Why me? Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you. Oh my fucking God.  You're gay. Come on, you know the words, sing along. No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you. They perk me right up. Heh heh, thanks. No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death. Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ... At-at-at-at-at. Knock it off! Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts. Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing? I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. No you're not. The fuck you laughin' at? You don't got half what Tehronne got. My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield? It's fine, thank you. Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think? Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was. And I'd like you to call me Ann. He kept saying he was protected. What does that mean? Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. Like how? I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried. The only proof is those bodies. So what do we do? Move the bodies. Move the bodies? How much we looking for? Nothing. George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold? To hell with Arnold... He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us. Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree? I don't know. Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody. Supposing he wants to get bad with us? Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it? When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know. I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down. I thank you. And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am. I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get. Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight. Take plenty of cigars. We made the date three months ago. I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact. She quit this afternoon. Oh, man. Who are these people? Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency? What is this?  I got work to do. Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker. Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna? Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior. Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims. Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school. The floor was wet. She slipped! Why was the floor wet? I don't know why the floor was wet! Why?! Luck, Jim.  Don't forget. Have some cigars. No thanks, I don't smoke. Go on--Give 'em to your friends. No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark. Saint Severin... You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris? You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance? What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you? There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138. Thank you. He's my brother... My poor baby! You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out. Do you know a Marie? No... do you? Why should I? I don't know. See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details. Next week. Someone's shut off my money! I know.  Where are you Adam? What do you mean "you know"? Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls. And? You're broke! But I'm not broke. I know, but you're broke. Where are you? Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night. By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai? Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got. They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left. They didn't get my contracts. They--excuse me... Prepare for a site-to-site transport. Sir, we won t be able to bring you back. It s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter... That's an order, Commander. I thought you were going back to the apartment. You said you wanted these. How's it going chef? Okay. Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime. What are we gonna do up there? I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in. Fuck you. And that's tough, isn't it? Without someone to teach you, it's tough. Creasy? Sorry I woke you, Ray. Preach on, Big D. Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker. Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours. Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya. What do you mean "don't worry? Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen. It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you. I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day. ...they say you're alright. I'm fine. This is it, then. What? The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you? He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault. That's not what I hear. I was flying...my responsibility. That's what you get flight pay for. Maybe I shouldn't take it. Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen. Not to me. You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part. Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother. Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA? You are <u>defending</u> what you did? Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it. Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins. Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success. Good golly miss molly you are looking good today ! Thank you. I meant him. They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger. You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more. What about Jeremiah? Nah. Just you. Did you ask him to come visit? You already did. Did he mention it? Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you? That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up... What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow? Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit? Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow. Good luck. Jesus, are you gay enough or what. Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you. ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal. Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it. Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth. Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good? Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving? I don't know. The L.A.P.D. When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too. My secretary? You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism. No, I wasn't, actually. You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all. You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up. I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it? Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that? The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff? Look, you cocksucker... Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you. Fuck you! This guy got on the roof in like a second. Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves? They don't want to come down. Why not? Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason-- Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you-- I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere. I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms. A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then... I haven't even been married once yet! Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing. Sam, let's go get married. And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps. I'll lick the stamps. I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know. It's a lovely garden. Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long? No. Just a few hours. You're leaving after you see Cathy? Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious. Actually, it's none of my business. Weir. He's dead... How much time have we? Roughly ten minutes. How far to the station? Three or four miles... Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas? None in sight, there aren't many along this back road... Not many car either, not much chance of a lift... It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again. What a BITCH! I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed. But Uncle Al! You said- I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming. Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest. For what? For seeking the truth? Please come quietly. You come near me and I'll blow us all up. We're not going to hurt you. Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal. What deal? Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis. Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying! I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl. I am not being brutal to her! You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen. Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics -- Getchmis olsun Getchmis...? Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish. --listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it-- --go over your sources again-- The fuck is wrong with you? I gotta go to the bathroom. ...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind? Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started   I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me   my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper. Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts? When's the next business trip, big fella? Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about? I can arrange that. I like that. Who? Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants. But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type. I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun. The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones -- What the hell is this?  Who are you? Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you. No, you look like a hooker. Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk. Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? Sure.  For five bucks. That's ridiculous. The price just went up to ten. Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart? Sit... and spin. Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not? You girls ready. Yeah. Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid. I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help... Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out. No, this looks like the real thing. Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right. I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right. Ten A.M. Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry. I'll see you around. Last one to the Midnight Star buys. Where's the nearest telephone? Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even. No. I'd want a public phone. You're from out of town? Yes. I'm cutting a record. We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come. Is there food? No. Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything. No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually. Oh great! Hey there's your Dad and Shelly. Sorry.  You asked. No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money, Where do I sign? Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes. No. Will you come in, please? What? I want you to come in till I get the lights on. What for? Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on. What is he? I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it. Oh, a little savage, is he? A proper Aborigine. How you doing, great one? I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction. So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face. Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined. Which is guy-speak for... Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long. Travers, you're not running things. When he finds the money, you're as dead as me. Are you alright? I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp. Because my mother was dying! But now she's not. You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life. And you are a son who doesn't love his mother! They're having a laugh... WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody! That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on! Vital signs have stabilized. That's good. Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances? He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see. But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right? I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station! We'll explain the whole thing to them. I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours. Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter! Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here. If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe. Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em. When did you last see him. November the 28th, last year. You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit? No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th. How would you rate this one? Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris? Maybe so... I wouldn't give up your day job. I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident. Oh... My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton. He's a little farther gone every time. Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams. Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world. I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work -- What about you? I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards. Uh... Everything okay? Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily. They takin' water? Yeah. He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it. We don't know that's true, he never said that. I can feel it in the way he talks to me. Will I believe you when you tell me something? There's nothing left for me to lie about. I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie. One believes -  it's like any other religion... I'd hardly describe It that way  - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing. It seems right to us. I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice    that's it, isn't it? Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you -- I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst. I always thought it was a more intimate relationship. I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions? Am I a doctor, no, but... Are you an expert in amnesia? Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him. Believed what? I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown. So he fooled you. If you say so. Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through? You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice. You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death? You mean, did I want a date? Did you? These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans. Some women like Dobermans -- What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out. See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from. Why should I? What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out. Thank you, John. You're welcome, Grace. You're not from around here, are you? Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package? You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day. I just drove in this morning. Drove into Sierra?  What for? Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road. Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure. Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert. Least you can leave. Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take. And here I've made you all hot and sweaty. Maybe if I used my left.... No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger. Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini? Hit me. That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game? J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom. The man in jail is always for freedom. Keep what handy? Nothing. The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet. At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace. And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks? You look good. So do you. What are you doing? I saw something, I saw... What...? Tell me why I miss him. He's dead? That's right. He's dead. Tell me why. How should I...? Tell me why he's dead. Hey, mister. The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon. Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me. Just now. Guess who? Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean? It means nothing. We look good this year. We'll kill Fairfax this year. I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus. Fuck him. Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus. What are we delivering? We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business. Who is this fucking Ruiz? Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him. Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass. I gotta pick up the baby. Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid. I like it. It's not even yours. I like it. Hell. Ten? And which of these doors here lead up to the security level? Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss. Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight. He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand. When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter. And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief. The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know. Gee, thanks boss. For certain, no. But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning. For the third time, yes. A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan. You're more gutless than I thought. How are you? Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses. It is so considerate of you. I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight? Sure. He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us. Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice. We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine. If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of -- Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating. I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along. That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it? He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear. No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me? Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes. What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too, I know one way you can do it. How? Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born! Life signs? Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg. Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major? Yes, of course. Thank you. And if she runs? Take care of it. I only met Kurtz once. Would he remember you ? Maybe. And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much? I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls. Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is. ...paper? I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the.... I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since. We haven't talked since high school. Yeah. I'll go check on your boy. Just a few questions? No. You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too. Why the fuck would I do that? Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me. Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak. What happened? Eee Oott Auught! Sorry. What? HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched! Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary! Jabez! Mary! Come back ... Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you? You deserve to die alone for what you've done. I don't know what I've done. Yes you do. Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay? No. I don't know what I've done. You should know better. A dime. Okay. Who else? Are you okay? I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny. Let's go for a walk. One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck. Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare. What else could it be? Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare. <u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony. Oh, Mom, it's so ugly. Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed. You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped. Hell of a way to die. It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels. After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part... I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s Are you always so bold? No.  I'm shy and I'm selective. Daphne... Yes, Osgood? You're leading again. Sorry. If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it! Ike, you could make a song outta that! Isn't that cute? I just taught her that. Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here? Seven-ish We have to make it an early night. They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach. Hmmm. Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh? Hmmm. It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses. You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit - It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it. I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades - Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is? But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to. Not my problem. So wrong -- So it is going to happen after all. What'd you say? I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone. We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena. Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you? It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments. ...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose. It wasn't petrol. I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night. It doesn't matter. Who is it -- ? Castlebeck. Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you. That's true. You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl! I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go. Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts. Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it. Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line. My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live? Four years. We don't want to be disturbed. My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned. If you want to see us you must come later. I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier. But you can't... What? Abbott wants to talk. Tell him we're busy. I tried. Madam should sleep. I've done my hair differently -- do you like that? When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently. In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette. Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train. Goodnight, Suzette. Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops? What? If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose? I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam. Quentin, how's your gear? The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein. Was I at that dinner? Just tell me - You were wandering around. Was I at that dinner? You were wandering around. Was I at that dinner? You were wandering around. Was I at that dinner? You were in the m- You were in the building. I was in the building! It's noise. It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay? Charming chap. Nice puss to meet in a dark alley. Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan. Ten seconds, Rod. And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it... Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out. Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy? You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me? Don't be pitiful. I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the  bermensch! What the hell is that? Dr. Weir? I don't know. He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide? No, we have nothing to hide. We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing! Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry. No hard feelings. C'mon, I'll buy you a drink. You haven't got any money. All right, you buy me a drink. That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who? Nurses. So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild... He is? He's doing very well. I heard that they were running cold. The nurses? Yes. You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well. With River Oaks? River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week. Himself? You're late. Didn't get much sleep. Well, we've got -- Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin? Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records. You come to the right place. I guess I did. You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you. I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay? Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here -- We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned. Is she? Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner. You lost me, Sid.  Who? Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus? I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station. Jack!  It's Christmas! No.  It's felony possession of marijuana. Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows -- Are you insane?! I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free -- Let's talk about Conklin. What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it? I want to know what happened. What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left. So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap... I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done. And Bourne? Where's he now? Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows? I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne. We'll be back at the platform in... 20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore. 20 minutes.  Susan? Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is? Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit. What are you doing. Low on gas.  Got to refill. Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me. I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account! I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it. You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman -- From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you? These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs. Goddamn bitch. Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me. Very good, busyboy. Dwarf bowling's illegal. What are you gonna do, call the bowling police? ...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration   That's all right, really   Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here... Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day! He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>.  Goddamn! Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay. Whew! - where that come from? Found it. Growing in a garden. Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway... You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto. I just need to run up and get my bathing suit. Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes. Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious. They're just leftovers. Is it chicken? I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast. Is this being recorded? This is just an informal discussion. Are you recording it? What does it look like? It looks like he's writing everything down. That's because he is. Does that upset you? No. Why should it? Well, then? I've never seen any of these men before. Take another look at these two. I don't know them. And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you? Yes, I suppose so. Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President. Yes? Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops. I am aware of what a condition red alert implies. Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base. That's a very wise deduction, General. Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance? Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today? He wasn't able to get out of bed today. I hope that it's nothing serious. He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth. Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time. ...Well, I've got a large family. How many kids do you have? Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children. Eight children! No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. That's amazing. There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure. Hello?  It's just me and you again. What about the others? I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves. What are you doing now? What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted. Forget about us.  Just save Rachel. Tell me what she looks like. They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun. I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out. Steven -- -- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak -- -- what...are...you...going...to -- -- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure -- -- wit...nesses -- -- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby -- What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building. Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up. Hello? Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here. Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist.. So, just how big was this fare? 5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect.. I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy? That's where we came out. It's a lot of money, Pam. We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop. Still... For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price. I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in. Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going? Bathroom. Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours. I remember that speech really well. I had you pegged, didn't I? You had the whole human race pegged. Probably. I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that. I know. It would be different, if we could just give it another go around. Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can. You have to be nicer to me, Dad. Go to bed. I think that you have to be nicer to me. Go to bed. Didn't realize you were watching the clock. I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. Nah.  Don't sweat it. Quincy... For real.  I should be alone, anyway. Ere.  He says he's not dead. Yes he is. Sweetheart.....Is this really you??? MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me. Don't call me that confounded name. Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend. I'm cleaning my stove. You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself. I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean. You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks. I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him. Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine. But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me? I guess you'll find out. No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself. No. I won't let you do that. The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London? Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers? Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot Yeah. So? Just checking -- keep out of sight! This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work. David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud. I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN. Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her. What do you mean? Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner. I want a full-scale investigation. You know what that will mean for Lombardo. I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case. Meet me at the other location. Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?! Now? Now.  No, don't kill him. The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out. Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better. You think I scam? You're unlucky. You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out. You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price. The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel! Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public? Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest. You can cut the bow. I have not understood what you means. That. It's out of the act. Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane. All right. Your phone. Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal All right. Have a nice Christmas. That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots... Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with... I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows... It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims. Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.? Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't. He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up... Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that. You're afraid of him. This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants. I'm giving you Clint outside. Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry? Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for. Yeah, that's pretty much it. I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this -- What was your name again? Michelle. Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom? Really?  You seriously want to go with me? Yes.  Seriously. Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool. Whatever you want. Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp... Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose? What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer? Let's go, c'mon, get up -- Did we win or lose, I mean --? I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over -- What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea. I'm wounded.  Oh, oh. What about them? Am I as good as they? Hmmm - good coffee. You didn't answer my question. Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me. You still didn't answer my question. Well, if you don't know I can't tell you. Looking for someone? You never know who you'll see. Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock... Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you.. This is against the rules. So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of- -Okay okay. You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute. Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened? I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper. Again. Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times. You stopped. The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside? We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they? Oh! Trim it! I hate that. Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now. No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now. Okay, so maybe later. You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks. Ignorant art? Yeah... Like   stupid, ridiculous, crummy art. Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good. Ten bucks apiece. I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. You don't even work on your stuff! Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging? Why don't you fellows get your own news? That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38? Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what? Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand? Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...! What? Since when do you care about the homeless? Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood. Forget it, man.  It's not worth it. NO! Yes!! She's fine, Charles. Take it easy... Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen. Half mile up, there's a clearing. You gonna dig up that lady's husband? I'll call the coroner. I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too. Hey, I thought we come for a drink. Huey man I got to talk with you... So talk... Alone... Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired... He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy. Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle! Oh, okay. Like this. You've never been to a dance, have you? Only squares and nerds go to dances. What are you? I don't know. The Golden Warriors. I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander. Where did you get those letters? I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo. Give me the shooter, Jude -- You're crazy -- Give me the fucking shooter! What are you talking about? I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house... What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here. Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there... I'm going with you. You don't have to. I'm going with you. Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language? Well--I can *manage*-- ...You pick the option with the applicable rate. I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed. Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living. Yeah? All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up. I'm going to California with my brother. They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start. Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing... The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his. Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste -- What time does the show go on? Eight-thirty. Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right. All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street. Meet you in the lobby. Okay? See you later - Righto. What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone... They stole the phones. Where criminals can come in here... they take the... They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him. Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half. Ah, she's okay. Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah. For God's sake, when does this end?! Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay? Okay. Well, I'm sorry. So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away. Dimmy, you worry for something? No momma. You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter? Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am. Gary, hi. You look a little tired. I'm okay. It's going well! Have a look? Sure. Where's home? Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you? No, I'm not. Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them. That certainly makes you kind of special... Yeah... I guess it does. There's no transportation anyway this time of night. We could steal one of the choppers. I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up. What have you been up to? Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on-- The torture of small children-- On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights-- Hold those rights. Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man? Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again. Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go. We could get back together too. Were we together? I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help. Did it? It helped me realize one thing. What? You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother. Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home. Kay, I'm sorry... Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of. Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him? Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny. He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met. And that's where you met Jenny. No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant. How'd the two of you hook up, then? Oh, Jenny was in my acting class. She left.  She's gone. What do you mean?  Where did she go? How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out. Well call her mother. She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno... You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me. Disco blows dogs for quarters. What do you want to do, Scott? I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff. But I have a visitor. Not today, George.  Time to go back. But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter. Okay, George. Because she's visiting me. We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time. It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture... How did you settle on the amount? We thought it was just. You thought it was just. Yes. Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy. That was our insurance company's recommendation. Yes. It would be. Look, Doctor! Well, this explains the music. But who was playing it? ...No. Will you stay here till I fall asleep? After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table... We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this? Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander? You're really into God, right? In ten words or less? Yeah. My relationship with God is my own. But you think about Him -- It -- Her. Don't you? Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies? Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny. That's easy to say; it's not your father. I was as good a son to him as you or Mike. Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way. We're all tired... OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day. I'm sorry about all this. Me too. What's going on? I'm going to throw out these old videos. No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this. Right -- let's talk about rent... Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives. Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this? Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean -- No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth. Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to. Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know? Mother -- ? May I speak with you?  Alone? I am preparing for a ball! We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy. What's this about? Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back. Bring out your dead! Here's one! Ninepence. Mike?  Is that you? Pop.  I'm sorry. It's okay.  What happened? Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world. I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray. I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you... I... I don't know. I don't really think I should... Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late. ...I better not... Well forget the art show... let's do something else. I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I -- Well when can we do something? It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know... I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it. After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else? Roper. What? Are you going to make this hard for me? Depends. What's up? There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up. Define concern. So how are you really doing, Panes? Why don't you go fuck yourself? No.  Really.  For real.  Really. I'm worried about your Galiano. You're a shit. No, really, five thousand with your discount. Fisher, let him talk. But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be. Pete, you're through! What do you mean -- through? I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make. Fred! Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side. Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature. I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete. Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister. If there was any way out... If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back. I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred. ...This shit's not bad. -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert. And that? Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer. Jon, where are we? Veidt s complex. No Mac, please... I -- Don't look. This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle. Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals... It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money-- --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it. Gordon Liddy, you mean? It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it. Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way. There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact? Let me check. There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way. I can't... not yet... There's no hurry. Take you time. Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer? Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building. How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son? Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week. Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son? It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship. You looking for somebody? Wha'? You here to see somebody? Yeah. Who? A girl named Amanda. What she look like? She's like this high, dark hair, skinny Yo, that's my girl. She didn't say she had no man. I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from. Here, don't panic. I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting. They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me? Mr. Bialystock ... Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you? And you think he's kept this to himself. He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating. Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe. Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts. Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair. Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc. Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself. But Doc- I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much Sorry, sorry... I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me. The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming. Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance? No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything. No, I don't. Come on! I don't want to fight you, Dignan. Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that. What did I do? You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do. All I did... You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight. You're hurting my arm. You must come in first place to move on ! Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit. I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass. You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over! My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie? Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead. I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was- When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you? The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye. We could smell it's breath. I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime? No, ma'am. Those fuckin' deadbeats... My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said... Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories... It's Church. I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered. Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty. Where you from? Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement. Seriously?!? Would I lie to you? He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does. I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh? That's the rub. Oh, as bad as that, huh? Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it. What is...  ...Coke? A drink. I... You want to try it? I want to try it. This stuff could kill...  Be my guest. Sir. Sir. Hah? We're really in a terrible rush. Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money? Sixty-five. Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93. Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops. You're going to the office?! You're not smiling. It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff. But James. I mean... How long? A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection. Jesus, James, you should've told someone. Who? I don't know...  Me. Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man! Down or off--you're giving me a migraine. Christ. Nice looking kid. Going to be okay? He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all. They'll make it. Close the fucking door! NO! Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'. That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati. Could I come with you to getting a Gelati? If you want to. Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back! Octopus people? Uh, it's a deep south expression. Relax. Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here. [Pointedly] Of course you're not. ...Feels like you. Case... Shhh... Don't you advance on me. ... of you. You'll all end up like this. SHIT! Give me that!! A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold? Well, I really don't drink... Oh, it's all right. It's organic. I needed to know. You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent. -- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line. I'll believe it when I see it. Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you. I feel naked without it. Jesus. What? That's the <u>reason</u>. Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything? Mister LaPlante... Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages... Mister LaPlante... Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man. Mister LaPlante... Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake! What is this place? This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City? I was on Earth... Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself? Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source... Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that? Look at this car.  Are you kidding? Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface... Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention. He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach. The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf... Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys-- This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I-- Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct. Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some-- No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth-- Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun. No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State. I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello. I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different. Oh, it is? Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death. That's him. What are you going to do with us? I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal. Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head... Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do? Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force. You see, you knew the answer all the time, General. But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President. What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets? That certainly would be a problem, sir. Yeah. You disappeared on me. How long you staying? I disappeared on you? Alright. What did you think? I think it was a disgrace. You sure you don't want me to stay on. No.  No.  Thank you. You go home. Man, they're defended... no way in. Flip six, three hole. What ? High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score... Tell me what's wrong. Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me. How can I help you with the particles? It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis. Typically, the subject being copied is terminated. TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now! Negative.  She is not a mission priority. Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me! Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here. Why?  'Cause you know him? Peter... Yeah...? There's some weird shit here. Weird shit...? Take a look. So, do you think you made it into the class? I don't know, but I sure hope so. You could use the grade, huh? Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college? Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not. Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear. Huh? Gear. You know, clothing. Oh. Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this. Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore Mm-hmm... You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better -- Excuse me? Brother and sister no more. Now husband and wife. What are you doing? Loading a gun. What for? Kill myself. Are you crazy? Yep. Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head. Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too. You're not crazy. Hear voices don't I. Of course you do! Then I'm crazy. He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here. Describe him. Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me. He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly! She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison. Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par. Your turn. Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!! How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me! Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say. And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>? I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need. What did you want my hair for? Something else I want to try. Mary. What are you doing here? She came to help, Howard. Wanted to say goodbye to him... Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five! Charming Schuvaloff. Black-eyed Sczortarska. Dark Valdez. Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight? Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight. And he doesn't care about me? He is only curious to know who you are. If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here. He loves me, as I love you. Will he wish to know the details of this night? He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him. Tender Hegenheim. That guy rules! Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do... So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun! No. -- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo. That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns! Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here. I'd like to discuss this. This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does -- Come on, let's go. Bye Mrs. Sennett. Bye Ma. He's insane! We should follow him home. Yes... ? Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator... I said I want the truth. She's my sister and my daughter! What's left over? Hold on, give us half a chance to count it. What about all the gear? Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing. Thank you. The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and -- Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies? What's she waiting for? Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her. Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting? I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me. My letters of appointment. Appointment to what? Viceroy of the West Indies. Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland. That's hard to believe. Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government. These guys're good drivers. They gotta be. Yeah. You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix. Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over. You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head... Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!? You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you. Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right? Right. So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job? Okay, Price. You stay. Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me? I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives? Of course, senor. Thank you. This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least... Well, why not say the least and get it over with? Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened? I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper. Six thousand, right? On the nose.  I tell you what, because you re so cute, I ll take care of our incidentals. How does it feel to get that much money just for being you? Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens. That won t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense. It s okay. Hell, I ve never paid for it. But please don t feel like you have to explain yourself to me. I can't believe we're stealing. We're not stealing.  We're borrowing. No, we're stealing. This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves? Then, why'd we tie him up? It's holding... She's holding...! We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole. Am I one of that sort? You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name. I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before... I came here, looking for her. I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel? General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R. ...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew... That's enough! The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you. How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir... Come on! His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... Now what? Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful. Ever think of what they might have to do to find me? Find You? I'm not gonna make it easy. Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny! You bastards!! Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma. They found this in Dickie's place in Rome. Somebody's taking a shower down there. That'd be Lily. I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day. Who'd you go with?  That's not good. How'd you do it?  The new you. You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product. I know it starts with a birth certificate... All new people start with that... That's not your Grandfather. It is, y'know. But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him. Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all. You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer? I certainly did not. Can I help you with something? I was just wondering. Wondering what? Are you two gals all funny with each other? What? You know... a couple of queers. Do you believe this fucking girl? I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch. Time is money, George. We need extra beer today. Business is good at the hotel? Very good. I am always glad to see you Paul. Helena, please.  This is out of your hands. I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with. Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs. Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown? Now, what did I do to deserve this? Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these. Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone. Oh it does??? I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again? Holly Martins. No, sorry. It's getting late and... Don't talk to me!! I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it. I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this -- No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child. It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again! Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book -- No. What do you mean, Fettes? I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane. Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray. Bob's in a hurry. Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball. Sink the putt. Make the shot. Nothing but net. Never say die. Didn't realize you were watching the clock. I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. Nah.  Don't sweat it. Quincy... For real.  I should be alone, anyway. Who brought me in here? I won't be a moment. Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange. Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him. You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here. Now what? This way. You know her? Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now. No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel. I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn. Please. Shit! Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab. I'll need the sergeant's okay on that. We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told! Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction. Thank you. That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this! That's all, Ned. Thank you. He'll kill us. He can't kill us.  We're on his side. Remember high school? Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands? Listen -- could you stop crying, please? No, I couldn't. But could you try? No. Do you want a Coke or something, Reba? I'm fine, Francis. They couldn't wait to see you. Who... are they? This is the staff of the Bijou. Oh.  What... what time is it? Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start. Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams. How do you do. My brother, Tom Hagen. You wanted to see me sir? Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now. Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. These two holes are yours... Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left... I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else. Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I... I don't want to hear about it Jackson. You don't want to hear about it? That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore. Right... This is one time we could sure use Elias. The elevator wasn't working? No, it has a mind of its own. This is funny. Yeah. I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem. Ok. Alright? ....Hi..... ....Hi..... Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh. Yer late. We can't stay in here! We're sure as hell not going back out there This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack! It'll hold! For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could- Dylan, where's the man? Here. What do you know about classical music? Nothing.. Selling is selling. Charlie. About last nights.. Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts. But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand. Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why? Why? After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever... I don't think you're gonna make it. Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything... Your Highness. How do you do, my friend. Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but... What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job? No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels. My jewels?! I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels. Why do you bring this up after so many years? They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris! Alexis! Do you know what you are saying? This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them! I know it's not a diamond but -- A moonstone. Your birth stone.  I thought -- 6... 5... Found it? How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush. We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around? Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye. Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat. Just be patient. I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs. Be patient. &quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot; &quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot; That's nice Ben. AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap? I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street. Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business. Same car. Third time around. I seem to remember that you like to help yourself. That's not very kind. Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way. Who? A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai. But what's it look like? What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing. Is something glinting? Everybody goes there. You may as well invite her here. Will you be okay? Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself. We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer. How long? By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you? I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer. They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police. All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away. We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors. That would be no. I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else. Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind? You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself? If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open. So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral? Gonna have to put up cash. You have it with you? Miss Price! Miss Price, please! Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here? Yeah.   We just go home. We can't. I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane. This must be the last straw. Here's the one that broke the camel's back. Someone didn't want us to get to the party. I expect we'll have to gatecrash. Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase! You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here. Fine.  I'm takin' Amy. You're not takin' Amy. I am. I'm wakin' her up right now. You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here. Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse. He a Black man or an Indian? Both. There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast. Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating? Carrots. Raw? Uh-huh. Want one? No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat. You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me goodnight! I hate the horrid stuff. This isn't going to work. Why didn't you say so before. I think I did. She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica. Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will. Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident. Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen... Pig Woman agreed to take a test. I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> .. I don't know where it is! On the side!! Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon? What does your lawyer think? Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down. But you don't agree? How do you know? Why would you be here? I told you. I was hungry. Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well? I have a sore throat. Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets... Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit. I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him? I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you. Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... One of yours? Gabriel. I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age? No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother. I'll see to it that he serves under me. Thank you. Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you. That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style! You don't understand, I can't! Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going. Let's do it. Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed. You got it, sir. 38. This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful. Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl! Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote? Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there. I'll be there in 5 minutes. So how long is this trip? Four days. Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you? They're from my old convent. See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it... Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh... Parry. Parry... I'm Jack. I know... DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night! We went to a hotel. My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again? I don't wanna talk about it. We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow. How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted. I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something. Think of what?  We're fucked. What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that? You really don't want me to play huh? No I do, Captain Howdy said no. Captain who? Captain Howdy. Who's Captain Howdy? You know, I make the questions and he does the answers. Oh, Captain Howdy.... He's nice. Oh I bet he is. Here I'll show you. Ricky's not wearing one. Ricky, can you put on a seat belt? We've got to save her! We can't leave it up to the Feds! Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor. Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow. Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right? Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up? My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me. Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and -- I think someone broke into my house. No shit?! No shit. I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something? No. You like the car? I said new, this is an '90. It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new. So do I just follow you? Yeah, follow us. So let's do it. Vamanos! And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen. Amen. And how many lives have you destroyed? I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine. What happened? I had an accident - I fell down stairs... Is LESLIE here? No he had to - he's just - he's out... He saved my life you know - has he told you... Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest... Vito Cornelius? Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of. That's cute asshole. ...<u>sadly</u>... Hey, lost again. But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution. I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... The great and <u>beautiful</u>... Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that... No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle. Thank you. Or clear your windshield with it. ...what a lovely perfume. Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there... Who was that on the phone? Wrong number. You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace? I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name. Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead.... I may call you worse than that. Anyone else not coming? Right behind you. -- you've been a tremendous help to me. Yeah? I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me. That's... good? Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is. I don't know if -- You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you. Of course. Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence. Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all? Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel. And put it on expenses? Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea. See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder. Well... maybe... And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do! --ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it -- Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for? The Children. Where are your children Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends. Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice. What's so important in Los Angeles? Your father has business. Why today? And why'd she have to go with him? Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant. I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into? Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers. I won't allow it. I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation. I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are. I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you? You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank? They report it to the IRS. You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want. Why'd you bring him here? You're the shrink, you tell me. As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me. Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me. They did a nice job... Cozy, huh? I love you. So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night? Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes? I guess I'm kind of... It's all right. It's just been a while. We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you. Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York. Saddle River's in New Jersey. Saddle River, New York! It's in New Jersey. New York. I think it's in New Jersey. It's in New York. Oh, I didn't know that. Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right. I had a good time last night. I really did. So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay. We'll speak soon. Night. It's really a tremendous turnoff. You should see the one we wear when it rains. Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni. The what? You know, the big machine that cleans the ice. Oh yeah. It's quite an honor. Will you come with me? Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you. You wouldn't! I would though. Shortie!--you know my motto? Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business. Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office. Now you're talkin'! I think you better leave. Melina, Hauser sent me to do something. I'm not falling for it. He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good. Get out! You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George? Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey. Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in    providing he has brains enough to climb aboard. Well, what about the Building and Loan? Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it? Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over? Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife. I'd like to do that. In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers. All right, sir. Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm. Turn on navigation lights. Don't hang up! <u>What</u>?... Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby? Now I ca-can't remember. Let's take a look. You came for us.... Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this? Thanks for the promotion, man. No prob... Hi, Plato! Hi. Take me away from here? Home? ...somewhere in the light. I'm sorry; of course, you know that. Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy. Connie's outside. Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared. I know, honey.  Me too. Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you-- Like what, Mr. Taylor? Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good-- Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but-- But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through-- What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor? Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life. He's big as a bloody bus! The water ski show!  We have to get them out! ...Let me get my coat. I'll just help myself to a cocktail. You guys going to a costume party? We're superheroes. Really? Like Captain Amazing? How's Linda? Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing? I like it, Nick. Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why? No, I mean I can check it for you. Oh, sorry. Who is it? Avon Lady! I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful People can be kinder than you think. I am afraid. Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee. What do you mean? Well.  There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.  That I kept instead. Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die? I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this! Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing. Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go? You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him! David? You call your teacher David? It's his name. Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba? Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us. Uh-huh. You think he really believed it? Who knows?  It worked. You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie? Hello? Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet. Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care. So these two girls come over to the bar... Hey, Ang'... ...and they sit down right next to me... You want a beer, Ang'? I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...

Waddaya read there, Joe? Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh. Can I talk to you?  When you're there. Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying. I'm looking for a lady who works here. Ladies would be elsewhere. Have one of mine. They're awful.  They make me cough. Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some. You're a darling. Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle. I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack. Are you sure this is the river road? I saw the sign. How you doing? I'm drinking. Slowly or quickly? As fast as I can. Come home soon after the show. I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table -- -- did she talk to you? She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose. Did you tell her? I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march -- I love you. Love you too.. Bye. I was just playing...we were playing just playing around. She's dead. So long suckers. Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac? You want me to be a doll forever? Claudia - don't - Why not? Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott! Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she? How about this? That's not bad. That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing. I believe it. I turn it on when I confront the guy. Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas. How do I know that? What if it isn't over? Maybe you should tell me your dream. Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew. Yes, I was. Recommend we proceede, Captain. Mr. Decker... ? Hey! ...from Mavis, also. I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny. ...What was that? Weird and tiny huh? Hi ...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear? Pretty well. I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog. Yes. Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them? You knew her? What? The girl. Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured. Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake. He doesn't have a temperature. I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>. Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...? Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are? Jean-Luc Picard. Great name. French? Yes. You don't sound French. ... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father? Yes, sir. He died...  ... in 1972. Yes, sir. Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode. It's true. I know. I spoke to my friend Magda. Nancy! He's too strong!  He was never this strong! You were holding it upside down weren't you? Shut up. You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second. You think you could do better "Laredo? Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit. Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that! My name is Louis Peluso. Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way. Yeah. The clock's already ticking. Right, then... We got -- I don't know, we got separated Before or after the explosion?  Mueller -- I don't know! It's not a Nelwyn baby. No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini... Isn't that the point? Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up. Wish I knew why. Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out. Thanks, Chuck. Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way. Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers. Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him? In due time. But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for? I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death. Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done. One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin. Everything okay? Just felt a little chill. ...Is that not true? Who's writing this guy's lines? Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation? No, I couldn't get my hands on one. Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed? I never saw him. Why didn't he show up? Did you expect him to look you up? Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face... Have you tried to ask the God for anything? Well... no... That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter. Bullshit. That's your "rep. Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again. Good morning, everybody   Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you? Have you seen this? Yes - the worm! I beg your pardon? He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him! To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers! In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all. Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing -- But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility. Your credibility -- yes, it's well known. When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all. I'll commit that to memory. Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher. Gallagher! Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight. I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform. Oh, that's not a problem. Show me the animal, Jerry! Right up ahead, buddy -- Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer. Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know. Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'. I wanta see Nathan. I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you. I don't understand that, Sheriff Young. It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime. You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband? That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders. I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young! I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble. Will they give him a trial? Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it. You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff! Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking -- You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan. We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood. If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say. No, I don't think so.  That's someone else. Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there? You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names. It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon. You think this was Clawsen's initiation? Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked. So Chicago's been good to ya. I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me. Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket. And a lot more. Can we talk? DADDY!!! Yes. Anything else? Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist. Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall -- Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest. ...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian. ...Uh-huh. I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though. Ah... it's nothing. I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are? Huh. You're an enthusiast. Huh. Yeah. Maybe... I was hoping we could have a special evening. I won't be late. Did something happen today? Perfect. All ginny. Except it s Scotch. But I m not taking your name, buster. I m a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey! You know where he went? What's he done? He stole something. From a friend of mine. He must be a good friend. We're very close. What'd he steal? A chip. Goes in a computer. One chip? The most important one. Can you help me find him? How do you know you can trust me? Got to trust someone. I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything. Sure... I'll see you around. We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night. Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge. Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so. Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow? I'm on deadline. Aramis... These are... these are whores! So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her. Did she have tits like that? You've... memorized...? What was the end page? Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS. Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick. Come on. Daddy? Yeah? I'm sorry... That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late. One day they'll find a cure. You brave soldier. I'd hate her to grow up like that. She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child. Be careful with it. Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more. Do you have me? I think so. Show me. When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day. I know.  I'm sorry. Sorry, my ass. Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age. I would completely support that. Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS? Okay, give me the numbers. Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side. And got well paid for it on both occasions. The winning side would have paid you much better. Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here. I have my orders. Oh, I see. Gestapo spank. Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there. I don't even know this woman. Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time. Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going? I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week. My vacation is over in a week. I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise. I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient. Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that? No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while. Can I help you, sir? I think so, daughter.  How old are you? Eighteen--  and a half. A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle. Sir? Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand? Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink? What time do you get off work, my child? I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man. Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire? I'm engaged. Daughter--I love you very much. You don't even know me. You are woman.  I know woman well. This is crazy. Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me. What do you do for a living? My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there. Some kind of animal? The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man. Yeah? Hi, Rob.  It's your mother. Hello? Oh.  Sorry. Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray. Abby-- Mom?  Eve and I have to go. What? I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you. Look, I showed you my badge... Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks... The Department of Public Health... ...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf... Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor? Please do.  He's a lonely guy. I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset. You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight. Ryan, would you rather swim or work? Can we really help build a house? Helen, tell Matt I want to see him. Yes, sir. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that? I didn't think there was an alarm. Take him to the car, Bob. Let me out of her!  Right now! Answer the question-- How much money did you leave up there? Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning. You're trusting. Why do you say that? How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take? Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched. Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish? I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off. Do you think anyone can see us down here? Why? You wanna have sex or something? Ooh! Can we?! Really? I was kidding. Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me. Typically male point of view. How do you figure? You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you? Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there. Be there? Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat. How flattering. Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge. Oh, you think so? A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent. And I actually date you? Something wrong? I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough. I touched a nerve. I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life. It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization. You were making a generalization about "broads! These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me. How many? How many what? How many girls have you slept with? How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once? We might have; I don't remember. How many? Including you? It better be up to and including me. Twelve. You've slept with twelve different girls? Including you; yes. Come on, bro. Let's go. Hey, wait take this. Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter? No, I ... I was just ... worried about her. I know, Johnny, I know... . Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this    to remember them by. Whistler! Are we bringing home strays now? Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here. I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with. Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em. Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke? Smokin' it up here, Boss. Edward, I can't. Shush.  Of course you can. What if I lose it? You won't. What if someone tries to steal it? I'll guard them and you with my life. Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber. You don't understand anything. I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously. Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me. You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days. Do you remember where it is? What? Where you lived with them. Okay. Maybe some of that is true -- You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend -- I don't want to be just your friend -- You don't know what you want -- You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you -- And why would that scare me? Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God. Why didn't you just tell her the truth? I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages. Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just-- You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis. I'm thinking about going to bed. Okay. Let's catch up. You go first. Well, there's not much to tell. I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences. Bad experiences. You met people. Bad people. Watched television? Bad television. Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku. What's that? It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever. That'd be good. Crabtree. Ye-es? Are you okay? What happened? Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all. Who is it? It's Beaumont. Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy? Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries. Chances of recovery? You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze. Hello Brenda. Hello Ray. And video games after! Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"? Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared... They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk? And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way. Yeah -- we'll see. Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there! But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human. You're not going in there -- ! I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically -- Don't do it, Norman! Do you see it? Where's Mrs. Moebius? Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes. She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--? You wanna take the chance, Casper? Not me. No way. Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car. And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table. Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs? By name only. Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get. Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest. I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out. Jake -- What? I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack. OK. Talk. Why don't you just call him up? What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say? No, not that. Then what? I don't know. Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct? Yes. If you had a... reprieve, what would do? There was a third man - he didn't give evidence. You don't mean that doctor? No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue. If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me. Who's is all this? What is it, Treves? Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil... Don't do this my son. Open it! Have you no fear of God? That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing. You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live. Oh, you'll live, Lilly. Eddie? ... Yeah? Are the TV people with you? Yeah. The camera guy is here. Send him away. Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I -- No. Do you want us to come in the kitchen? No. It's a mess. Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you. There's something else, too. What? Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side. Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you. And that's a <u>good</u> thing? Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this? An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator. How does it work? With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA. No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley. Simplicity, Hawk. Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us. We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned. Is she? Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner. You lost me, Sid.  Who? Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus? I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station. Jack!  It's Christmas! No.  It's felony possession of marijuana. Impossible. I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him. Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office. Life is waiting. Well, there's only one thing to do. No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning. Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second. What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna? Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me. Yeah, well, what's your religion? Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I-- You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something? Take our literature... Uh-huh. ...read it over, and think about it. Well, okay.  Thank you very much. You're welcome.  Hare Krishna. You're a dead man. Leave him alone. Fuck off. Oh. Hi. What do you want, Stan? Can I... I brought some -- I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta-- Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you. I don't know. See, I have this condition. Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead. Come up to Boston with me? Sure. We'll go next weekend and -- Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight! Um, okay. I'll call my study partner. Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit. Grampa... watch the language. I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs. Mr. Galvin's... Let me talk to Mickey. What is that? Piss. I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them? Victor did. Hey, how'd my car get here? I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam. Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right. I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present. You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you? I remember him. Cut it back a little bit. No fucking way. He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead! Will it restore my gift? The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week. Hello? Hello Sidney. ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him! How much homework is there? That's the downside. There is none. Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend? You can bring whatever you want, little friend. ...he's two floors below you. In my office? Where are you, what floor? Seventh, files section.  What should I do? He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police! Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure? Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot... Why were you yelling like that?! What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here... Why?  Are you waiting for someone else? Yes! Who? Otho, that's terrible. My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth! What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I? You can help her. Holly... Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you? There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do. No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person. Is it me? Is it my fault? It's not your fault, it's her fault! But what am I gonna transform?? Me! What are you doin' now? Running blocker. Where's he headed? He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there. I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while? Good night, Mother. See you in a minute, sweetheart. This is Betty at twelve. Very graceful. Perfect form. Betty was a lovely child. You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened. I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people. What are you talking about? That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different. Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around. Fair enough, I'll take it to my place. Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand? So what're we gonna do? ...What do you mean? Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but... But what? I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin! That's why I hate experts. Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it! Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent. -- Eddie... You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look -- So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating. Well, whattdaya think? That's great. Highly original. You're late. My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go. Oh. I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way. Shouldn't you be in mourning? I am. Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay! Sort of a Jack London style? Exactly! Notice something funny about that bus? Yeah. It missed the last four stops. Can we find her? Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run. Coffee's perked. When did she die? Is...? She's dead then? Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button. That's okay... Well, yeah, sure... I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform. To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke. To life. That's all there is. Believe me I know. Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather. Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report. Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me. How's it hanging, Miles? You know me. I love it up here. How about you? Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you? Highliner. Glass or bottle? Bottle. You got it. Say, is Maya working? Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy? Hey, girl. Hey. Your hair looks so cute like that. It's okay by me, peanut. Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me. Jean? Yes, Patrick? Would you like to accompany me to dinner? There was a third man - he didn't give evidence. You don't mean that doctor? No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue. Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you? Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie? Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal? Nah, she asked the wrong question. What was that? What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt. So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer? Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over. Okay. What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal? Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you? Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another. Yeah, right... Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know. ...and if I did, what's in it for moi? A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with? You find something curious in that? Yeah, I guess I do. Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left .. And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who? No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either .. What happened with Rick? We'll discuss it later. What's the matter -- restless? Yes, people make me restless. Even women? There aren't any women here. I suppose that's your wagon in the river. Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on. And you're all alone. Yeah. Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio. Stick up? We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking. And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity. It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"? Yes. I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it. Yes. I'm pretty nervous. Are you? Yes. I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants. Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick. Is he all right? I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling. He ran away? Actually, he took the car. He boosted the Jag?  Is that all? Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car. The _Rolls_? _No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_! Honey, I think that was a mistake. I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there. But <u>we</u> let him out. I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it. You the only sentry? I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome. So what do you want with her anyway? I'm a good friend of hers. How do I know you're not lying. Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her. Probably.  One of the many. What? Nothing. So, wait, what are we dropping off? Goodbye. We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick. You must have had fun. You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up... Can I kiss you too? Naw.  I'll take the zero. You feel good, not nervous? I feel fine. Not nervous?  Relaxed? Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready. How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks? He'll catch on to it in no time now. How did you get in here? And what do you want? We came to see Professor Barnhardt. Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda. You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me. I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive. What? I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time. Did you work with him, Keith? At the Half Moon. Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready. You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals. Prep the launcher now. Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender? May<u>be</u>. No way! Come on man, what'd they look like? I don't like her. You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes. Don't bring her to the house no more. What didn't you like about her? I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around. Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma. Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig? Yes, sir. So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! What is it? No problem. Look, I... You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low. Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter? You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it. You know her? Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now. Hello, Peter. Just a second.  Hello? Loretta... Johnny... Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death! Good. Have you come to make peace with me? Well. Yeah. You may not want to. Of course I want to. Fuck me.  Let's go home. No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this. Manolete?! Who the hell's Manolete? The great Spanish bullfighter I don't wanna write about no spic. No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains-- Why ain't his pick swinging? Why ain't that pick swinging? Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half! This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there. It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding. It'll never happen, fuckface. Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop. What's that? I'm a puppeteer. What do you expect me to say to this? How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"? Uh, Jack - look, I can explain... Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these. Made your million, yet? Not yet. How's TransOcean doing? Not this Thanksgiving, you know. Here.  Be careful with those. Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's. Where is Rick? I don't know. I ain't seen him all night. Good. And something else that might interest you. Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy-- What? Your mother will be down in a few minutes. My mother? Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held! Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you? They missed the boat. Thanks. Glad to help. How are you feeling, Fernando? Not bad. Oh! OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean? Hans, he killed by brother -- Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl! Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in! I'll talk to you later. We did. It got lost in the shuffle. What? We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands. What's more important than sanitation? The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there. Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity. A common thief. A patriot! ...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth! Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful. Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class. Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money! No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class. We start our own class? Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather. Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ... Forget it. Seal the cave? That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy. As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house. Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy. It's all right. He don't mean anything by that. I don't, huh? It's nice. Would you like to see the rest? ... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great. Thanks. Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street. Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle. Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle. Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing. Is that the one who died? Gabe. Heard of them. They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case. It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives. And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge. So what are you going to do? I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison. They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank. Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me. Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute. Well as it turns out I did. They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns. They could try to tranq him on land. They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down. What the hell took so long. Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long. Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not. Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it. Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us? Jack.  I said the kids are asleep... Well that s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful... You boys'll have to go to work early. You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it. What happened to the lights? Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em. Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail. But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life. Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead. Mph rm. Bye, Dad. Goodbye, Mr. Rieper. Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy.... It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse.... Will you get the bloody hell out of here.... Could we sail to Venice? Sure. I love Venice. I have to go to Venice. See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list. And Rome. Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class? Joe -- How nice you look.  Is that your uniform? He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself. Can you be quiet? What'd I say? Would you like to be a little more precise, sir? Well, that's the wrong line for a start. Sorry? You got a special friend, Jimmy? How special? You want one? Secret agent...How much is that? Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman... Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week. I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night. Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald. If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something? I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you? I kinda doubt it. So? I love you, Joe Therrian. What did he say? He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over. Do you remember his exact words? Who did it? Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it. Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun. I have a gun.  It's under my bed. You don't know what you're fucking with here. Tell me. They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next. What can I do? I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me. I... I can't! You have to... No! Hi mom. Hi princess. Mom? Yes? I need to ask you something. You can ask me anything. Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman? Hi. Hi. Heard you had quite a night. That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy. I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know... You know? Yeah. Do me a favor. Sure. What is it? Hit me in the face. You want me to do what? You heard me, I said hit me. C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks. Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw. Jack, I got no gloves. Here's your glove. The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here. Pretty. Hmmmm. Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile. Who says she's a suspect? What did you mean:  I'm 'out? Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome... -- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him... He's been tested for drugs? Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that? Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up. Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved -- What...? Run! Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately. I'll have to enclose the check first. You do and I'll fire you. We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon. I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales. I been thinkin'... Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money. We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do. Like a party for all our friends. Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along. Hello, Harry. Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta? That's part of growing up, honey. What? Having spring break ruined by will readings? Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President. My ex-husband works in satellite communications. Is the word given? The word is given: warp speed. Aye... Don't push me..! Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you. Holy shit... ...man! Oh, shit. Back up!  Back... ...up!  Come on, old... ...Pete!  Come on!  There it... ...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby! All right, you got it. Fill her up? No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine. So you killed him? I... He sighs. And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann. Of course they are. Wasn't it, Keitel? Well... I... I thought... This is your house. I know. Eddie from Compost? Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl; That was good. Yeah. I'll see you later. Ok. I don't freak out very often. What do you mean? I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok? ...I don't know what you mean.... I don't freak out. Ok. Have a good trip. Thank you. Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer? Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber... We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy! The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox. Wait, let me take that. Huh? You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it. Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds? Is this a lover? Please! You read Russian? Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background... Someone want to tell me what's going on-- --and we brought it back with us! So, why did you take me up there? I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat? Are we getting married tomorrow? No. The day after tomorrow? Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. Program name? Resurrection. Whoa, Earl! OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!! What are you doing, Earl? ...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out. I hope your tail holds out. Oh -- Sam!!! Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ... Not now ... please What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do? Haven't thought about it. Hell you haven't. Get to thinking about it, it won't happen. We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do. Ain't there yet. Three days, man. Not yet. Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs. Nothing further, your Honor... Mr. Concannon...? I love you Don with all my heart. No. it's not Don. You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side. I thought you hated those people. Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street. Good seeing you again. Whish the circumstances were different. Good. You're just what I need right now. You got a minute? It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you. Who's doing this? I gotta go. Will you hang on just a second. We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first. Right. Is he staying here? He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer. Yes, sir, name, please? Food! Do you have a reservation? Food!! I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation. What the fuck?! They shouldn't have come without calling first. What's he doing in Utah? None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off. You followed me. Orders. To kill me? Nothing personal. How can I go? Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going. What? Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week... Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But-- But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing. Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers. Vox -- Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays... I got to get home. Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you. Who? I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head. It s been interesting, that s for sure. But I ve done some good things too, haven t I? You ve been Jack Campbell.  And that s always a good thing... Don't forget these. Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh? I think they make you look sexy. George! Yeah. You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums. Buffums? Yes, Buffums. I've got heads here, Norman. You promised you'd do the show. Oh fuck, Norman! Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon. He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it. No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself. What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet. That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim. Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father. These are wonderful. It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now. What's baseball? It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher. Like a painting? No, son. A pitcher. Like one of Mom's? Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat. The nocturnal flying mammal? No. Sit down. That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict. Why are you telling me this? I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel... Well? I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again. Good thing you have a voice-over career. Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine. That's thoughtful. Yeah. ...Okay All right. Put me back on with him. An evil vet? No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something. An evil petting zoo? You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil. No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather? No, my lord. What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in? Yes, my lord. And, is that a pitchfork beside him? Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord. Where's Gilbert? Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby. I'm really tired. Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty? No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS. They say sex is great for cramps. Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory. Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately? Oh, sure. Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is... Can you - ? Jim, I don't even know his anatomy. He's stubborn as a Stone. Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he? An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace! I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring... What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds. I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant... Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that... I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice. As much as Joe's? The Prison of Belle Sur. Come, we have a boat waiting. But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system. But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling. Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir? You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest. I suppose you're right. Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy. This may hurt. Well, don't let it. What are you doing? Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you -- But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy. Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night. We made it ! Awaiting my orders. You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well. I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse. You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement. No. I beg your pardon? I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients. Are you Juno, our case worker? Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available. We need help.  We deserve help. Well, thanks a lot. Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on. Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would. And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you. I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in? Locked and cocked. Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven. What? Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible. It was a somewhat extraordinary day. I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ... Are you sure you don't need it? I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on. What do I do? All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either. No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob? Lila, it's Rosie. Go the fuck away, Rosie. Please, honey, let me in. Rose, please go away. Lila, I want to help you. You never thought of the possibility? Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me! I care for her. I don't want to see her hurt. I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie. As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul. The United Nations are still here. The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right? Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about. What did you overhear? A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel. What did they say? The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything. Watch everything? How? They are gone. Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission... I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone? You have to dial nine first. So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading - Want an animal cracker? Yeah, OK. That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm. Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings. I hear you. Yeah? One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand. [Then what do you have to lose?] [It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.] We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you? You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money. No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me. Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation. Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore. Anybody bitten? Nah, just covered with batshit! They went out over there: must be some kind of exit. He told me about this.  You got this from Containment? Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch... So what's up with you? What do you want to know? The good stuff. I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler. What else? Are you trying to rap to me? You want that for here or to go? I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate. If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house. I'd wish for a puppy. One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred? I only want one. A foolish wish. And you, Quell? What is it? Something's coming. Cool. Can you say anything but "cool"? Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things... What do you want him to do? I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary. Hi Jody. I just wanted to check that you were okay? You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books. Which one do you prefer? The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then. Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me. Glad you could drop in. Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee? I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury. Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub. I love you, too. Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over. Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait. What? I'm lonely. He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry. Don't watch.  I can't if you watch. I thought for sure they would catch me. Thanks. I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore. I know that. I know what's at stake here... No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet. About the baby. That... and you. What's going on? I think we're going to exit the space port. What is it? It's a thought I had. Should I open it now? Hi. Hi. Want a drink? No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so. Was he nice to you? Nothing. It's got to be. Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today? Fine. Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance. I've heard. Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him... Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in? Yes... Yes, let's go in. So you're testing <u>me</u> now? Oh, I think you can do it. Probably. Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me. How romantic... Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing! I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out. Mr. Lundegaard? Huh? Yah? I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here - What... What is it all about? Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here. N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh... Mister Washington. I want to hear the truth. Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that? Why do you think I blew up your condo? What? Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me. So who are you? What do you mean? Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you? I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it. Yeah, well, that's what I do too. What? Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special? Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound? Of course it does. I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?! I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think. I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something. Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now... I do what I gotta do to survive. You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face. I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out. I'm your blood. You wish! Make sure. Okay.  Okay, I'm sure. You feel nothing? Nothing. Open that door, damn you! Daddy, what's the matter? She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately! Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover... Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for... What a perv... Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock... Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you.. It's the Chancellor. Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion. What are you putting that crap on me for? Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other. I'm sorry.. This is a police control action.. You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June? You are? That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think. About what? About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida. What's in Florida? Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds. Going to catch yourself a rich bird? Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste. You're entitled. Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine. Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller - I want mine to wear glasses. Glasses? Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed? Well, now that you've mentioned it - They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal. Something's not right... -- Mulder! Get in the car! Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace? ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way. You may go, Lieutenant. Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts. Goodbye, Sandra. What is that?  A handkerchief? It's nothing ... nothing. Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts. In your dreams. Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics? Are you busting my chops or what? What are you doing... ? Get out. I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead... Get out of my car! You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on. Didn't they tell you? Tell me what? Punk rock is over! I know it's over, asshole, I -- If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside! That's not even -- Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money? Danny... I can't make it. Yes you can. Is he good? He's damn good. Natalya? Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation. She married a hockey player. I envy your 'undercover' assignments. We work in the dark. We do what we can. So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us? He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody! Lori... Yeah, sweetheart? Let's do it. Do what? Move to Mars. Ooh! What a filthy mess. Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal. Why not? I need to get in there! I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route. That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich. I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel. No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room. That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it? I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but -- You said things would be fine, and they're not. I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But -- I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me. Blue moon... Blue moon... Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>. ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment? Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch. Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here? Yes. Louise will bring me lunch. Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today... I see... ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here? I live here. You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that. Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas? ... How long have you been living here? Ever since I can remember, since I was a child. Since you were a child? Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden. Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere? I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you. Well, you run on now. Yes, Ma'am. I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died. Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up. You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie? I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs. Well, how about these two movies? Are you alright, young man? I think so, thank you so much ... Where are you going? I'm leaving. What do you mean? No... No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants? She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing. Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!! Now you want Arizona dollars. Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire -- That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake None of that's true? Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead. So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people? My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him. Is everything okay? Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies. But somebody wrote those songs. So, what's your point? Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all. No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination. Have we met? I don't think so. Did you know Sebastian well? You might say that. Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood. That's right. I'm sure you're going to love it there. Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed. I understand. As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him. All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo. Airport Ho-Jo! I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a... There are soldiers. Where? On the street. So uh ... Maybe we could uh ... Cool. Cool. My side. Get that doctor. No doctor! You're hurtin', man! No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro! You seem sad, Spooky. I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush. The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you? An interesting idea, Majesty. But - Yes? You already commissioned an opera from Mozart. And the result satisfies. Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart. I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes. You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea. Sire. Well. There it is. I only wear ties for funerals. You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen. Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya? I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle. I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack. How long you been with Ordell? This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever. What were you two fighting about? He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you? Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage. So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops. It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse. You better take off. Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing? They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor. While you eat, you look at the view. Oh, Will! Yes, some of it is speakable. One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elys es"  Why there? I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody. Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you -- A letter? May I see it? Well, she's back.  No thanks to you. Where's the money, Lebowski? Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge. Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute. Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door. I remember.  Hi Roberto! What room have you got? I don't have one. You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?! It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else. Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido! Enzo drop it, I'll find something. What, Lewis? There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship. With food? No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them. I don't believe it. ...Dad? Yah. Stan Grossman called. Yah, okay. Twice. Okay. ...Is everything okay? Yah. Where were we? Witnesses. Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate. Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up... Yeah? But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man. Oh, you're both so naive. Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool! JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines? Closer?  I can try. What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant! Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man! It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money! The Hoopsucker! The Hudswinger! The Hoop-dee-doo! The Hudsucker Hoop! She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson. Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something. She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid. A bad combination. Nine minutes! Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right? What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before. You'll see a lot of strange things from now on. Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow    you worry me. You got someplace to sleep? No. You don't huh? Well, you got any money? I'm alone. Git your ass in here. Maybe he's wise. He don't look wise. Get out of here -- I'm not leaving without you. You don't understand. The Thirst -- Hello? Frida? You okay? Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive. Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over. God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower. Sure. See ya. Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around? Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this -- Is he supposed to look like that? No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still... Huh? I m not as square as my daughter thinks. I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright? Fine. What will you do? There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon. They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution. Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading. Exactly.  So... logically ... If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood. And therefore? Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police! What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag? I don't think you're very polite. Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;. I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him. Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir? Would you like a drink? I'd love one.  Whatever you're having. Know what this is? Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing. A cylinder recorder.  My own design. The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill. I wouldn't know. Surely -- What I do, I do for my Queen. Was there never ambition? Maybe, once. Then I envy yo. Why? To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work. I do what I do. For Her Majesty. Aye. But yourself?  What about John Brown? I said.  I serve the Queen. No other aspiration? He's gone sweetheart. He's gone! Get away, get away!! No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life. Man? Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am. It's a piece. Your sure as hell right about that. I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York. What can I do for you folks? How much are your rooms? Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two. What in...? Captain Clayton...Captain! Hit him again. INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY. What is that? Our greenhouse. Oh, I like that very much. Yes, so do we. Do you trust me, Julie? Not a chance. Come on. Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire. Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent. Who are you talking to? To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert. I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was. But you did -- I just heard it. It wasn't me. That was close.... Anna, I think you better stay.... You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun. I think you did it. Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke. What the hell are you talking about? Damn, it really hurts, Mom. I know, we'll be there soon. You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife. You think so, Frankie? Hell, you got steady work. Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure. Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren -- -- Your employer? -- Mr. Lindgren. Who's Mr. Lindgren? My employer. What line is he in. Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding. I see. Based in London, but with international concerns. I bet. Various enterprises, style of thing. I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life. Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly. Right. Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you. In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren? This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means. -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him. Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody? Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City. I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"? It does to me. Yawn. The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange... And his soul black as the Ace of Spades. He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key. Yes, sir. All stop on the engine. You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man. You know I won't be seeing you. What about the legalities of this...? Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights. It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go. We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby. Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro? We're gonna blow up the powder magazine. What? We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage. A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out? Where is it? Underneath.  Somewhere. Hey, Gallagher! Yeah? How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach? It'll be ready in a minute. Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job. Sorry, boss  Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all. That was fun last night. Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive. Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her. Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan! You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common. There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors. We got a boat. What? I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff? I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles. What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs? The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles. Looks like you're the one might go to pieces. Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here! How did she die?  I wanna know. You don't wanna know. Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think. She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night. Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character. I wish he was.  He's real enough. Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella. Yeah ... Sort of ... We'll get you fixed up in no time. Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home. Of course, dear. You're home now. I'm home now. Why are you being so defensive? I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked. I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you. Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay? Bye. I love you. Bye. I'm, uh, going to bed. So early? Rough day. Good night. Thank you, Colonel. Captain. Captain.  Right, forgive me. Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd. Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal... <u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads... These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right. That's why I need your help.  You said you were good. I am, but ... Do you really believe me? I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was... You figger Scar means to kill us? He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us. Why didn't he make his move back there? I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality... ...Where's the transponder? In the truck.  I'll get it. On the bed! What...? No. What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete... Yeah? I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two. Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool. You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys? May we go home now, please? The dog!?  You are named after the dog... But, he's gonna jump off a building! Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle. Well, maybe you're right. We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton? Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state. Oh, swell! Is that the contract? Yes.  What's he doing here? Friend of his. They play duets together. Duets? But can we trust him? Oh! What's that tune that you're playing Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby. How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune. Digital laser readers. Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific. The sound of love. Excuse me? What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest. Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake? Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence? Temporarily?  Uh...sure.... I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned. Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that? What's going on? Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there. Dodge.  Dodge. What? Get up. Yeah, yeah. Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here. Where is your family? Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl. Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious. I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch! Okay, Pappy. Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop? Boss left. What do you mean? It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell. Then who changed it? I don't know. I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that? They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap. I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose. No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything. Sometimes it's the only solution. Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors! If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to  Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you. But what about this "Cinderella Man"? That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on? Yes, I guess I'll have to. Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor. Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair. Carla - Did you find Wilhite? No. Hello, Ford... What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority. You tricked me. You need me. Sergeant! Get out of here! Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off. Do they have a secret handshake? Are you all right? For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now. I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember. Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby. I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth. He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can. Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy? No. Did you used to? Yeah. Two or three. Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow. You were having a nightmare. I thought you hated this place? I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it. Spock...? As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales. Whales? Sergeant! What? Good shooting, Scotty. Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird. Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up... Will...I... What is it? There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep. You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan. Who else is left? Yes.  I see your point. Why was there another team? What? Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight. I don't quite follow you. Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>? You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time. We didn't do nothing, Eddie. You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride? That's all we did, steal their ride. Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off. I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle. I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle. Liza, settle a bet for us. What do I look like to you? Switzerland? What do you deliver on all those charters you...? I fly elephants for smugglers.... Listen, it's no big deal, Pop. Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head. I thought you were babysitting tonight. The only reason she babysits is to have a place to... Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing. Things happened. I can't take 'em back. There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away. Understood. That will be all. Sir, is there anything wrong? No. Thank you. Genesis, I want it. Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk. Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it... You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself! Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it! If we don't help each other, we'll all die here! Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>! Where? Behind Bob's house. Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her. I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm. Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already. Whose statue is that? I wouldn't know in the *day time*. I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus! Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master. It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it. Yes, by all means. We must try it. Did you reach the next girl yet? No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine. Send a unit. I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there. Call her. I just called. Call her again. They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something. Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat. Yes, I did. Just listen to them! Thanks for the advise, sir. Keep me informed. Didn't know you was workin' here now? I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today? Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole. Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob. What does that mean? It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already? ... Hmmm... Elevator. ... Yes sir - elevator! Sue them. I'll sue. Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa. The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy. Oh, you -- And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER. What? The door security systems are shutting down. Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he? I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid. You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be. Were you with another man? Go to hell. I'll take that as a no. Are we done for today? I believe we are. It's alright, baby. Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us. If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead. Who?  Who is he?  What is he? Your father.  He was your father. It takes all types. So who's he? He's what she should run a mile from. Then why doesn't she? Who knows the secrets of the human heart. Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there? Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower. And when you came downstairs, what happened? I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood. But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun? No, she'd stashed it by then. ...it's too damn risky. Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways. I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all? No.  I'd have liked to. Why? I'd have liked to talk to him. What would you say? I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff. What kind of stuff? You talked to Jack? Not since last night. He took a guy hunting. The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental. Jack? The other guy. Where... how'd you hear that? CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow? No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go. I'm surrounded by idiots. You need to get laid! We can't touch Hoover -- I thought the gloves were off. -- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him. You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have. Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead. Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die. I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own. Eventually.  Does it have to be right now? Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something. What? I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me. Well, what is it? If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that? Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage. That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room. Have you been in? No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer. Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to. My pleasure. Karaoke -- perfect. Don't even think about it. Okay, I won't. Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b... Thanks, but it's under control. Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal. We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready. The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash? Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still... Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work? ... No. You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy? ... No. In fact, I d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know... It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady. Grady... oh. Idiot... Good help is hard to find... Nice. The music? Or the fire? I crashed your party. Pretty shallow of you. That's me. I'm glad you came. Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time. Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes? Don't they have to be?... You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with. Leonard, what are you doing? Video lock. You got thirty minutes. INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT. Where are you going? I'm going home. All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire. Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that? I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident. Oh... My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton. I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini. Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours? ... yes, I follow your thinking on that. We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings? Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little... Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her. Why, why do you think that is? Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know? Well, I don't know. Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero? You're crazy baby.  I love you. Are you my big hard hero? Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you? Oh yeah... Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you. Oh yeah? Let me heal you, baby. Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus. Well? Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some? Later. What? I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you. Not know. Tell me, damn you. Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on? Do you know him well? Pop Leibel? Sure. All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat? Your place? I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in. OK. Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it. What was it, Mr. Hillyer? Nothing, Rose. Whatcha looking at, John?? Oh-n-no -- I -- Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble. Okay, okay. What is it?  I'm about to go on. We have to talk. I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family? That wasn't your plan, was it? What are you talking about? She's not available. We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous. Yes, Baron. And, waiter--you see that moon? Yes, Baron. I want to see that moon in the champagne. Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne. I want to see-- Yes, Baron. And as for you, waiter-- Yes, Baron? I don't want to see you at all! No, Baron!  I beg your pardon. Thank you. All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work. Thinking about Thorwald? And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left? Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it. You stole my boat. AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together -- I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you? I don't know. I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself. Why should you do that? If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot. You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself. What about all those ideas you had? See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind. Psychopaths sell like hotcakes. This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay. Check. Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ... Hi. Oh Hi, what can I do for you? Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing. Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family. Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society. I wrote that. No kidding? Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button. Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted. Still, make a note I recognized that. Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP. As long as it gets us out of here I don't really remember that. Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad.... Yes, yes, right. There goes a thousand dollars. Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars? That one did. ... two hundred dollars a toe. Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money! Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny. Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank. Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away! No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan. I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out. No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you? This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is. He told us it's in the Buick. We don't know which Buick, do we? Well, why'd you shoot him? I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do. He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead? Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife... He wasn't a lonely man, though. What makes you think so? ... Just a perception. Who are you going to see? Nobody. Oh Jesus Jesus... He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him. They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead. Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel. That's home. Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over. You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right. That's mustard! What? You just put mustard on your Hershey bar. Good... Pass the beer. Yo, showtime, showtime! What's going on? According to the map, we're just about at school. Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure. A blister shore can hurt. Yeah. Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that. Me, too. They're not looking for him. Why not? Yeah Walter, what's your point? Huh? What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg? Yes. I'm begging. I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts. But you'll do it? I'll do it. I owe you a big one, Hot Pants. You sure do. She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict. I believed her, Pete. Here. Don't even thank me. I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars. I simply don't have it, Joe. Get outta my way. You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there. No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove. There! You see! It could have been anything, Marty. What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you? No. No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I -- Just shut up? They're gaining on us! You gotta drive! I would bet on it. The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers... Were you ever going to say anything? Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth. You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you. About me? Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father. Mrs. Bledsoe? That's me. I'm Sheriff Deeds-- Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior. Yeah, that's the story of my life. You ever play one of these? I've seen 'em. Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone. You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick? I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away. He had the club out on the old trail road-- We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April. So you must remember Sheriff Wade. Not if I can help it. You had to deal with him in running the club. Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for. He squeezed money out of you? Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime. And my father? Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite. People didn't complain? Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'. Do you remember the last time you saw him? And you're in love overnight? I care a great deal about him, yes. Lee... Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over! I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it. Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder. You're pressuring yourself... No...no... Yes.   We've all got to let go. No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from. They're gonna mock our foibles. Our what? Our foibles, our foibles! I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here. Please go to no trouble. You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed. I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry. Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us. That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good? Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful? I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps. I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854. How much is it worth? The money is unimportant. I'm afraid it is important. In your money, perhaps $65,000. Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one? It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it. What's its value today? In human life? In greed? In suffering? In money. Forty-five thousand. Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one? A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps. And the last one? The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them. You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur F lix -- are they for sale now? Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty. Here's ten. Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively... Well-well, like what? First time for everything. I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine. There seems to be a discrepancy. Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6. I have 6 tons. Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity. You can't imagine how many men have told me that. It's been customized for sleeping capacity. Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot. Not as much as you'd think. Scott my boy, come here. How was your day? Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'. Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening? Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax. And that's how you want to live your life, is it? Yeah. What? I thought you were bringing the Colonel? The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken. Why not?  He eats everything else. Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile. Thank you. I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream. Alright. Let's talk business. Why not? Got a title? Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline. Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded. God... What? I used to eat there... Really good noodles. What is this about no water? It's true, sir, the water has been turned off. Where are your parents?  You have to try... Gorman!  Give it a rest would you. Just how serious is it, doctor? Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever. Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago. November, I thought. Was it? Did you speak to Tom? November 7th is my information. I don't remember the exact date. And when did you last see Signor Ripley? A few days ago. Does he stay with you here? No! No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat. It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day. 31 people. 31 people. I'm on it. Stay put.  Keep the camera trained on... Uh, beg to differ. Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank! Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count... Do you always punch people first thing in the morning? Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging. I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up! Don't push me..! Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you. You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys. I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back. So... you feel okay now? Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back -- If you came back. If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth. Something like that. And everybody you care about would be dead and buried. Something black  - something on its way to you    Go on -  Help yourself. Naw. If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive. What are you talking about? The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now. That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us. Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid... I just wait. You know? Huh? I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year. So do I. You do? Yeah. What happened? Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke. You're kidding. Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels. Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit. Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this -- No. No? Then what did he say? Maroon uniforms? Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security? No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake. Length, 22 feet, 8 inches. Come on, let's check the bite radius. The what? Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth? The whale's mouth? The Shark's mouth. What shark? ...Ray? Yeah. What was that? Your husband. Oh, many things... Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop. But I am also with the government. Here's her driver's license. You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer. I hate the weird ones. The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning. And the problem is you only got three. No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up. I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one? Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me. So what? So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak. They still have to take it to a jury. So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about. Why not. Are you serious. Have you ever known me not to be. I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king! You? Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream. And Jinnah? He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think. Wait and see... wait and see... Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick. Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they. How? Well... for a start... er... there's no killing... Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing. Well... isn't it great? What in the...? Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower. We've got to get the nanobot. It's too late.  Argon injected it. You mean he's polymerized, like me? You actually said that?!  Haaaah!! Shut the fuck up. Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look. It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out. So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean: ...ok... Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little... yeah. What? Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out. I don't want to mess anyone up... Give me a C.  A C! Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village... Good. Let's begin to move these people out... Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man. Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait. I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*-- *You* tell Jim Taylor. Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two! It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois. You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column. Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if -- No. I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr. What happened? Eee Oott Auught! Sorry. What? HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched! Oh, no, you were- I was just late. After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car. It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people... They said it was here. They told me this morning. Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids. You invented Space Paranoids? Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.? Senior exec. Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime. I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system. Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it. What's the plan? Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius. I feel like you're turning me into a VCR. I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes. It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again. What a BITCH! I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve... You'd have been proud of her. I'm sure. She was a revelation... To you, too? What do you mean? I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress... That's beside the point. It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them! Beverly! Not the Sterners! It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey. Don't let it pull you deeper! It's pulling me deeper! Don't let it curl around you! It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something! No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me... You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down. Maisy Blue Legs place? How'd you know? I got one up on ya. Go ahead. I've got the doer. I know who he is. You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't. Then why are you so upset? Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. Better late than never, right? Wrong. Program name? Resurrection. The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left. You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks. The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ... Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ... English? That's right. It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded. Highly suspect. What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic! Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true. I worry for you. No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better. I miss you. I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing... Do they have any reputation for drugs? No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers. And they loved Bear. Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott. You killed my Jody No. You didn't. I suppose I tried. You tried. Don't you want to kill me? Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool. Old fool!     You first. Fifty thousand. Almost exactly. A simple 'please' would suffice... Fluck you! Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway? I net a guy in a bar. Donald Segretti? That's right. Books. He's my biographer. Oh. Yeah Walter, what's your point? Huh? I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that. This is only a vaudeville. Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me. Do you mean that? I do. I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things. Are you ill? The doctor thinks I am. But - What? I'm too young to be so sick. Mike!  The party starting! Come here a minute, Fredo. Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women. Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann. There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma? She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you. We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick. You must have had fun. You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up... Still champions. Panes is not on your team anymore. I have to go, I'm sorry to say -- Be sorry for nothing. Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of. Ah, but you have heard of me. Anything else you want? No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy. You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded. I got to. Aw. Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot. We in radio contact with anybody up there? Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind. Did you reach the next girl yet? No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine. Send a unit. I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there. Call her. I just called. Call her again. Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it. Stop kidding. Wait a minute. Can you believe she fuckin' bit me? And she got the medium. Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra. What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too. Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there. How many of them are there? Too many. There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist. But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned. Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known. Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not. I am here, Captain. That's a little vague, Spock - The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning. Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her. I'm sure that's it. There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there? Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too. Of course. Hope their plumbing's the same. It is. Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it? Stop it. What're you, crazy? She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend. South African women are very sporty. Hi. Yes? This your place? Yes. Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody. Finished, son? There's only two of them now. This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny. Sloan, I got it like 'dat. Oh you do, huh? Just a little something' somethin'. I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'. Gots no intention of ending up broke. Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist. No, before my time. You don't read, do you? Never read a book in my whole life. Maybe you need to start. Maybe I need to do a lot of things. Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States? Better. Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever". Okay. Thanks. Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya. Yeah. You really don't remember the other night, do you? What night is that? The night before you showed up in the slammer... You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business. He's important to my business. What do you want for him, I'll give it to you. I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time. No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either. You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you? Are you impressed with our Anastasia? Oh, heavens - I must say, yes. Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana? Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls. Perhaps you could convince her? Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect. Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you? No, Dad. Are you sure? Yes, Dad. Where are we going? I'm sorry.  I've got plans. Again? She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong. I'm sure you'll be very convincing. You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please? Please, Francie... Daddy! The woman you shot. She was my friend. That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school? The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane. Is it awfully violent? Most assuredly. Is it terribly erotic? Fiendishly so. Where? Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke. Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch? You did. Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour? With that cast on -- you don't. Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary. You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert. Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments. I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track. You asked for something dramatically different! You got it! So did you. Goodbye, Jeff. You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors! Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me! Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be. What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon? Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here. What are we like in...1998? We're okay...we're good, Dad. Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off? You really wanna know? Yeah, you betcha. Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop. Wow. I gotta be going. Going to Turley, was it? Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado. You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that. What are you saying? The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them. Bullshit... George Washington! Who? Hello, he only invented money! Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba? Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates. This is Tibet. And this is China. Ahh. It's a single sequence repeated over and over. We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it? I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad. I don't think I have to now. Go ahead. You can say it. You're a genius. I'm sorry, honey. Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig! I forgive you. Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me! I forgive you. Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why? It's a very pleasant room, Ben. Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway. I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once! I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount! Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news. Can't be good news coming from you. Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick. So? So...got the keys to heaven, baby. What? The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth. I don't do that shit. Yes, Ed. Could we just talk alone for a second? I -- Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes? C'mon... Nah, I don't do that anymore... You used to dance... I said no. Want me to pull rank ? Well, excuse me, sir... What is Rose going to do? Where can she go? They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on. You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you! You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low. How low? You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind? I'd rather you didn't. What's the problem? I'm camera shy. You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture? Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business. He gave these to you? Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars. Frank gone? Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back. Bull. Alright, suit yourself. He's comin' back?. What for? Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight. Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs. Oh he forced you, huh? He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby. No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said. Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you. ...I can't haul meat no more. What can I do about it? Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside. What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man! He will learn patience. Much anger in him, like in his father. We've discussed this before. I just came here to talk. Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me? Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience. Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited? Okay.  Okay. I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you. Oh my God... God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all. Your bookie? No. I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother. Actually, she's silver-haired. Not...gray. Not really, no. Who was fixing to betray us! You didn't know that at the time! So I borrowed it till I did know! That don't make no sense! Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing? Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total? Ninety-three, including the sauna. Take any three you like. After you get settled we can... What? That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it. Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are. Well hello, officer. Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon. Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think? My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know. I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her? Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry. Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct? We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement... Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year. Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else? Goodbye, my love. Thorgan, suit up. This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program? No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead. This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division. I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell    Think she really killed those agents? She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill. Amnesia? Possibly. Split personality ... Insane ... ? Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out. Why? She may try to kill you. Come on. One more time. Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts. What kind of game? Turn off the light. Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy! Of course.  I'm a terminator. How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives! What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act! What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling? Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's. What do you mean? I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors. All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition. We're not interested. Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say? You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's? I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D? I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear? Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker. Thank you. Would you like the same suite? Definitely. The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute. The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up. Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire   I love that, I believe that.  Who is K? K is for Katharine. Lieutenant!  It's me. What is it? Dr. Green has to see you! Got my hands full here. It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something. I think it's nice he's American. I think it's fantastic. You realize that you've brought a killer into the house. What are you doing? My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on. Let me see it.  Did you drop it? No. Will they free me? I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge. Will this thing take long? No, it should be over soon. You mean it's started? Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything. How do I know what's being said? I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it. WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME? ...omigod, no... You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair. Positive. You sure? Positive. My friend told me she lived around here. Your friend must be misinformed. Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday? They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver. It's like War of the Worlds. They think it might happen all at once. How do I look, mama? Like a fag. I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room? Sure. You're welcome to join us, Todd. Humboldt County? Maybe... It's my father. He gets it from his doctor. Glaucoma? Colon cancer. Jesus, James. Wow. It was sinking. What was? Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows. You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song. Bye bye blackbird. Is that what she used to sing? I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die? I don't know. Like do you believe in heaven? I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it? I'm starting to forget her. I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom. It can't do you any HARM... What do we have to do? Nothing... I just immerse you in water... Yah, okay. How's the hotel? Oh, pretty good. They bitin'? Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel? Oh, fine. Not on your feet too much? No, no. You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there? Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good. Was it reasonable? Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there? Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good. Oh my God. Well, it's finally happened. How's that? We can't drink our piss can we? Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you? You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates. What are you doing here? ...walk? Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up. What are you doing? What? That's a ridiculous move. Why? Because, I'll take it. I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way. It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for? Who? I should kill you.							 * Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   * That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18. Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem. Really. Yes. Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either. Used to what? To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father. But how could you say such a thing? Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter. And have you any other truths to tell me? You already know what they are. You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad. Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry? Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether. Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut. Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few. 10-4 good buddy. Hmmm? It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna. So you were unhappy? Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it. Oh... Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka. It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage. Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest... Vito Cornelius? ...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret.... Right now it's on the balcony. Steve called for you. Steve? Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell. Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack. Your mother's family is Spanish? Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner. You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work. All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish. How 'bout the Sheriff? The Sheriff. The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available-- I'm unmarried. I'm not available. You told me one time it was true love. The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious. Do they have pressure? Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis. The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it? Nah, accommodation address. What's that, like a P.O. box. Something like that, yeah. Where you get your bank statements. What about him? Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard. Happened...Yes happened right down there. You saw it? Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue. Why didn't they bring him in the house? Anything...A feeling...a smell..? Nothing! My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck. When you wanted to run away, I called your dad. That wasn't a good night, no. I'm sorry. I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway. And why is that? Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us. More. Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life. How's everything? Everything is everything. How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk. There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding. I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn. Boca? B.O.C.A. Doesn't register. Got a wife named Angie. No, nothing.  There's only some talk. What? Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well. Who brings it? It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him. Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike. Dr. Frankenstein? Fron kon steen! My name is Gerhart Falkstein. You all right? We killed him. You killed him. Alice? Hello, Rae. What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family. Daddy's dead. Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books. Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven. Wow... read something. It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath. Nice work. There is one problem. I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing. I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing. Good luck, Captain. I'm going too. They may need a doctor. Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay. Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes? They couldn't break the riddle. Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet? We need your help. I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down. But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with. I can't right now.  I've got a game. She could be dead after the game. She could be dead now. What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage! Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu. Say anything in there about Karen Sisco? Just that she got away. Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn? You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be. I'm going to miss you. Oh, Rosie. And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me. Shut up, you. Don't move, Rudy! Standing right here, man! You ever hear of something called The Bible? Once, in church, dude. Who is it? What's it all about? Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards? Hey, Brenda. Do I know you? Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy. What is wrong with you? I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this. You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people. Really? No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float. Okay. Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'. Who is it? Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now. What'd it say? I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you. Tell me now. It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address. Get me a plane... Wait, Will... Get me a plane! I'll pick you up in... I won't be here. I've been meaning to come in a long time. You live in the neighborhood? Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by. How old is he? Four. You're great with these kids. Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees. --I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over-- --Cotter, where can I get on-line? --anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl-- Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma. Tripp. Yes. Hit your brakes. How am I gonna do that? Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way. We won't need it then. All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time. But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway. Come on, let's give it a dry run. Wait for Gus to get here, sis. Who needs Gus? Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...? I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel - Are you alright? Can we rest soon? Absolutely. Cameron, I'm a little busy It's off. The whole thing. They killed him, honey. Huh? He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down. Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God! You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you. I'm... dying. Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy. Avery said she was tight with his daughter. That don't mean nothin'. Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars. Ain't yours yet. Was he a good detective? I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right. What you up to? Just checking out the lights. There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about. Okay... I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he... Honey, what is it?  Just tell me. I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio. I know.  He loves that thing. No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future. Did you find it? No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet? No-o! Where's Lother? Whatever happened to you? There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ... Actually, there's someone I want to meet ... I know, I know ...! Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party. Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them. Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on? Until your confirmation date. Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust! Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep. Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason? Kaminski. Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide. Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid. What? They killed him. They threw him out that window. Oh no... Eight stories. PAIN! Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break. He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you? My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here. Come back tomorrow. I'll wait for him. Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before? ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died. Yes. Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend? He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young. Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps? ... Mentor...? You. You're the guy that lent me the money. Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep. Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say? Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet - Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise. Thanks. Were you? Yes. I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit. To what? Virgins? Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies. What do you mean? I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit. You mean like fucking two virgins at once. That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen. She's probably smash you in the fucking face. I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect. Did you tell her that you loved her? Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys. It came. 800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal. Very generous And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print. To do what? That's for me to decide. You're going to destroy it No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it. You're lying to me. We already made the same offer to the stockholders. Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation? No. Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship? No. Can I move now? No. I must deactivate you. For how long? Indefinitely. How long is that? Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all -- Mr. Follett. -- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew -- Henry! What the hell -- ? It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd. Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No. That poor girl is in a tough spot. There's nothing I can do to help her. But I don't know what's going on. Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue? Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ... Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid? No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue. That you found.  What do you mean you found it? Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill. It'll wait. No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...? Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ... I suggest that you leave with your men while you can. Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot. His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie. Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business - But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he? Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow? You have the night watch?  On the radio. Since September.  Last guys got transferred. Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello. There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us. Assure them that you're being well treated. I like Grandma's cooking.... Thank you.... What did you find? Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon. Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe? You guys are thrashed. Cinn? What?  Oh yeah.  Coming. Now son, you tell 'em when it came from. Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right. You've got to do something! Who are they? They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me. Maybe they just want to appeal. It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down. That's pretty complicated for a senior prank. I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank. I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me. John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency. I understand that, sir. Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you. Have they harmed you? No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me. Who the fuck are you? Ray Barboni. From Miami. What, like that's supposed to mean something to me? Hey, it's... been two years -- We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man. What is it? Thank you for seeing me. That's perfectly all right. So? It's your radiator hose.  It's busted. I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you? Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself? If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else? Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut... Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not? Yeah, I can fix it. Great! Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time. How much time? Time. You're not sore at me? What for? For  not being any help? Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it. What are you thinking? I don't know... Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean? Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification. Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses? Argumentative. Knight ... Black... ... death ... Love... ... death ... We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room. Leaving the room. Leaving the room ... yes. Got it? A private investigator... You re not Austrian? Should I be? What s a French private investigator doing here? Can I get up now? No! What do you want here? How do you know me? As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him. ...Leon s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn t know where I live. Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him. You thought wrong. I haven t seen Leon for months. Haven t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble. You-you re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I m in London. That s all. Rest, Highness. I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything. Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f... No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does. Do your best, Tommy... Oh god... Joyce can be nice. What'd she say? That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai. Oh, you will? No...I was hoping to get a kiss. Then why don't we just get it out of the way. The boss is getting hoarse. There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that. I don't have a lot to say, Michael. We have time. I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much. What about now, is there anything you can help me out with? I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know. We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well. This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it. You're going down there again? Yes. After what happened to us? I know I can capture it. Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac. So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating. Well, whattdaya think? That's great. Highly original. That was you?! You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this. Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming? Who? From the Korean War. Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict. Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course -- Of course. You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not. I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative. That's okay, Daddy. Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited. I couldn't have... much longer. Yeah... I know. But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out. I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it! Okay, Louise... It's okay. Drug evasion with.... triple three, triple three! easy..... Drug evasion with assorted perversions Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading. You have to go for help. I'll be right back. I'll wait here. 4000 degrees is usually the point of....? Vocasity No, Tetanty. I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck. Good luck. But they're somebody's children. Are you running a business or a charity ward? Well, all right . . . Are you Niki? Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture? No. Too bad. I wasn't in it. What do you mean, you'd rather die alone? I didn't say when I want to die - But the important thing is you're successful at it. In a way. But... But what? I'm better than the guy I work for. Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie? Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now... Comin' out here, Boss? Yeah. Come on out, Luke. Joe. What? Take the card. Oh yeah, thanks... Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars. Dennis. I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down... You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart. Really? I poop too much. Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant. Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired. Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these. Depends on where you want to go.... Doesn't matter.... You gotta stop smoking .. I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ... I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can .. How'd you do it, old man? Someone bet me a dollar .. A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar .. Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig? Yes, sir. Did you find Jane and Mandy? Could you call me back on your phone? Right away. What's wrong with the radio? Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>. Stand by. He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that. I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time. He liked to laugh. Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity. I'll put these flowers in water. It's me. Hi. Hi. Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence. Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember? Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office. Thank you.  I have no further questions. So we'll sell the house. I got married before, you didn't sell. Let me go. Children get off. I will follow on the next plane. Go. For how long?  We've just about run out of everything! We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then-- No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible! Well, I am the head of this household-- I want him to at least see the sky! --and we will-- And the ocean!  A mountain range! --do as I say! Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you. Exactly. I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service? No.  But I'll help you. Has he? Boy, what the hell's the matter with you? Then he has. Course he has. That's his wife. You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister. Yes, Mama. I don't want you drinking, Frances. Yes, Mama. I haven't worn mine in months. Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit. Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael. How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning? 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think? This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself-- Darling, I talked to Millicent. Okay, what the hell are you up to? It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes! Do you mean it ? I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write ! Bob. Bob Destephano. What? I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky. Computer guy. Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day. I sell BMW's. What do you do? Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really. Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey! It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you. Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!... And? I'm going to take it. Something else. Okay. Promise? You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns! That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work. Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business -- We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian. Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian. Doesn't matter. Move on. I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts. So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything. CAN THEY GET IN HERE? NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING. Hi. Looks like things worked out tonight, huh? This water's cold again. I'm sorry. The fire's gone out. They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery. Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows. Want to come to the study group? Thanks but  I'd better do history. Well, we were once. You know, that time. What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort. I don't like Katrina. I totally heard you did. I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup. It's temporary. It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you? Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night? ...Fine. Riddick? What the hell are you -- <u>Listen</u>. Come in. Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side. Well, that's all part of it. We've got weather moving in from the west. We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes... This place is deluxe. You got cable? ...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms. And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal. That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter. You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair. Positive. You sure? Positive. My friend told me she lived around here. Your friend must be misinformed. Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday? Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship? Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate. If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect? sighs. Can I go now? grabs Pauline by the shoulders. Two more nights in this lunar cycle. Double merde. Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit? Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"? Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead. Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them. Talk to them!  Heavens! We've got another one. That's no surprise. But it's a different m.o. Then what do you need me for? She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it. You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure... Besides what? Well... I don't know, just... the wedding. What? Well, I've been doing some thinking. Oh, you've been thinking. And? I may have to put the wedding on hold is all. Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead. Who is this... ? Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her... Who are you? They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her... No... He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes... No... no... no... They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her... Why... why are you doing this to me... ? They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time... Yeah. Do it! Again. No, please... I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me. Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look... Trouble? We've been ordered to - In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE. We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative. Wedded bliss? I'm very happy. Sure you are. I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past. There's so much, and so much of it is dull... Were we always explorers? No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life... Looking up at the stars. Yes. And you dreamed about what was up there. About... New worlds. You have beautiful eyes. You have beautiful eyes. I think that's him. Who? Haldeman. The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here? The past six months. Meanwhile, you still live in New York? You're nosey, you know that, Argyle? Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me. It's okay, it's okay. So, you divorced of what? We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa. -- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that? Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while. I understand.  I'll go with you. Thanks. It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them. I can get ten. No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you. Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her. She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night. Yeah. Ma... You'll always play with me? Whenever you want. Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair? In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair. So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview... Okay, everybody, listen up! Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers. Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed. No. Then what? Will they really find work in Germany? Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia. D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate. No, Louis!  No! Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!! No... What am I supposed to do? Now, wait a minute, Dad... Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain. Married? Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married? Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March. Yew-cheen chef-faw. Deck ten. He's bringing a girl? Miracles do happen. Does the girl have a name? He wouldn't say. Christ, what is going on in there? Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got. We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here. No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying. Thank you. Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you. They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree. Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns. I like it!  I like it! The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they? About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'... What'd Ned say? L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then... Then... what? A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T... An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done? Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was... Who are you calling? Cecile. You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time. Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit. Guess what?  Luther just got in line. There's a piano in the street. Yeah. Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help. Thank you. Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car? Ok. Oh -- Oh -- Oh -- are you -- are you all right? Few have survived it. Fewer will survive them. You're not in school? What do you do? I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift. Where'd you read all that stuff? I just read it.... ... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code? See?  No code.  What'd I say? Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it... Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic. Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain. Halloween. When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil. You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her? You can turn that finger around. Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you... No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible? Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him... Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time. How am I gonna do that? I don't know, figure something out. What's this? Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that. Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself. Yeah.  I've noticed. Are you serious? Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator.... No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic. I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you? Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money. We have to do something. We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know. I know, I know.... And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one. It's still a good idea. Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke. Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers.... A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident. Two of them are still missing! There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims? Maybe they are! I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. No. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life. But what about us? We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. And I said I would never leave you. And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now... I better not come in. I ain't stupid. I mean it's late, baby. I know where you're going. I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest. Too early to tell. Nervous? Nah. That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you... I dunno. Whatever will be will be... That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ... I don't really understand the meaning of the words. If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance. What time is it? 3:30 I guess. Give or take a year. There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible. How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it? Don't get smart with me, son. Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage. That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit. Thank you, Sir. Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant. What's in the two week package? First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville. How real does it seem? As real as any memory in your head. Come on, don't bullshit me. I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back. What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund? You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics. Spock... the booster rockets. If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate. Fire the rockets! This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you. As a matter of fact, it is. Good morning, Mr. Dyle. Reggie? It's the only name I've got. How about you? No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know? Why you lied to me. I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing. Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are. But you know my name -- it's Dyle. Carson Dyle is dead. Yes, he is. He was my brother. Your -- The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that. How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ? En garde. Lay on, MacDuff. What? What have we done? Take it easy. This time I was trying to do everything right. Don't just become excited. I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again. You're trying to make me feel guilty. I'm marrying your brother! All right, I'm guilty. I confess! You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo? She didn't like me. You don't get along with anybody! What did you do? What did I do? You ruined my life. That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life! Oh no I didn't! Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you? How 'bout me what? How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight? What are we gonna see? A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter". Who's Sonny Chiba? He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever. You wanna take me to a kung fu movie? Three kung fu movies. Don't let 'im get you tight. Whatta ya think that outfit cost? That where he was shot? That's where he fell. You get much of that in here? It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out-- Deal drugs in the bathroom-- If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands. I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple. Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?! Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here. If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe. Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around. Except I won't have a father anymore. I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk. Sure. Does that mean we are, or we aren't? We are... Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and -- So... how'd you hear about this? Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work. Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work. It seems fine. <u>Fine</u>?  Look here! The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870. This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole. What's the reading? You'll excuse me. Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game. Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom. For everyone. Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and... Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah? Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us. I can't do that. Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah. I hate chickens. Which ear was it? The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet. Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us? Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now. I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it. Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us. But that's what happened before. Not this time. I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap... Well, what should we do? I don't know! I just said that! Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done. Shit! Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie. It wasn't a lie. Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it. Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here? Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived. Okay, let me have this. Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with- Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick. I don't know shit about electronics.... You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned.... Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds. If you say so. Here goes. Are you married? Yes, sir. Any children? No, no children. All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions. Thank you very much. Next, please. Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil. Yes, I get the point. You need to get a haircut. What? And some new clothes. Why? We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can. You're just going to have to trust me. I don't trust anyone. Then show me how. You can see well in the dark, Rowan. Better than most, I suppose. Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead- Erica, you coming? Mm-mm. You did that? Eighty-two thousand dollars. Doesn't it worry you? No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me. Out? He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years. What do they do up there? Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young. Yes. I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely? You may speak. I have a job for you and I don't have much time. That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff. A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane. Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way. Insane. To make a long story short... But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face? I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't. But why? Maybe... because someone's afraid. Afraid of what? I don't know. The truth, maybe. -- About what? About Chinatown. What went down. What went down? You tell me, man. No. You tell me, Shu. How can I tell you what I don't know! You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it! I don't know shit, man! Goddammit -- Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot. Of course, Finch.  What? Whatever you hear about me, you agree. What are we gonna hear? You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip. She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder. Shoot him. Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game. So... pretend it's not a game. I'm just so lonely. C'mon. I've got the car. I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do. I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do. Are you out of your mind? Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez. God, I can't keep up with all your changes. Me neither. What's gotten into you? I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear. Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve. That's what gives me The Fear. Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear. Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me? Not much. Why? I have to go. GO? Yes. Leave the country. Tonight. Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours. No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody! OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left. Can we make it? That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door. I want to leave fast. OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. Do they pay you to screw that bear? Dr. MacFarlane -- Excuse me. And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein. Nothing in moderation, Clerval. He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying. Hiding something? It was in his bag. Now it's not. Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks. What's going on? Don't you understand French? I'm still having trouble with English. The man and the woman are married -- Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat. I do?  I guess I do. Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times. I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something. Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you. You're lying... Bud... If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all. What happened? The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave. What caused it? Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast. Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said... Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night. What's the matter? We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes. We have just folded space from Ix... Yes?... How was your journey? Many machines on Ix... new machines. Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans. Jane... you don't have to do that. Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains. Will you marry me, Jane? Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit! That's far out! This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha! So Tracy? Yes? Why are you doing this? Doing what? Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me? Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think? The word, sir? The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway. Count on our help, sir. I'll need it, Sulu. Congratulations, dad. My cheering section. Systems report.  Communications? Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be. Mr. Sulu? ... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant -- Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead. Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days. En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us? All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out. Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds. No. I don't want to see you. Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead. What about your agent? Hear anything yet? Nope. What do you think's going on? Could be anything. Been checking your messages? Obsessively. Huh. They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life. But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say? With computers. It's not the same, is it? Better than playing with yourself. I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested! How do you know? I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building. Did anybody notice you? I can't help it if men notice me. Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason! Leave us alone you sick fuck! Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself. Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to. It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something. But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact. Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes. [Beat] Why'd you stop? Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from? I don't know, but I think part of it's... John?  What is it? How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively? If you get a safe shot... I'll take it! Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>. Roy -- Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey! It's a hotel. I don't understand. Could they have built that hotel since yesterday? What's her name? Who? The woman you're stuck on. There is no -- It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue... It claims to restore monthly regularity. Ass right. Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down. Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind. Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard. I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here. Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible. I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines. If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship -- I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had. Oh no, my friend... Say hello to London for me. I miss her. Oh, yes. You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction. So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF? I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa? Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode. What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy! Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother? You know I can't. Then fuck it!!! It's like the basketball team. The basketball team? Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win. Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you. Indeed! Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time? Let me borrow your car. May I be blunt with you? If you must. We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing. I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure. There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store. Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that? How about I go right, sir? How about you take your position? Watts? What's his first name? David. David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid! I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter. Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me. Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current -- -- What do you think? How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's Would you like that? There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her. I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no. If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her: I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise. Fish'? Yuh? Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay? Well there's no time like the present.  Good night. Good night. No more counting the big money for someone else. Beholden to none. Would you grab my shampoo? Shampoo, got it! Coffee? No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them. I hope so, too. Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday... Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest. I'll see you, then. Calling my bluff, are you, Harry? I guess it's not that obvious, then. No. I knew you wouldn't believe me. I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect? Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he? When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations! Don't talk too loud. Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you? Sure I do, Earl. Maybe it's for old-time's sake. Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs. He ain't that way.  He's got heart. Yeah.  I know. Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island. Yes, sir. Love your enemies"... Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul. Oh, I have some suntan lotion. She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye. You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you? If you say so. You think these are tits don't you? Ah. I bet you'd like to touch them? Oh. Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up! Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician? Hello. Make an appointment. It's about this. Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool. What? Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you. I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head. They don't belong to anybody. Then take her to Radio Shack. Sigmund Freud? Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart. Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract! I haven't been briefed on any such thing! Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified! What the hell is it, anyhow? Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work. How much do they have? Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break! They won't break this one. Apparently my opinion wasn't needed. It broke! No one's that strong. A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ... But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it. What do you want, Vic? To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>. Are you crazy?! The guy came right at us! You turned up a one way street! Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed. Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store! Honey. How are you? I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker. I never cared about that. This is cute. Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real. Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ? You don't. It's random, there no trick. Great... Right - about face! March! First rank present! Fire! Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality? If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you. Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds. Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament. What year are you in? I'm what you would call a fifth year senior. But I thought high school is only four years. It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself. Who are you? I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet. He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory. In real life when does he hit you? My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me? Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on. I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir. I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you. The country's loving it. The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists. Why don't you go?  You should sleep. Would you like me to? Nurse! Nurse! You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am. Nurse! Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want. Nurse! Help ! You are a Catholic?? Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point. May I ask where your two warders are? Lying in the gutter where they belong. Do you realize how immoral this all is? Max, I've got a hit series. Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs. Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off. Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left. It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast? Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first. Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room. Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves? How long you had this? Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet. I'm sure. He's a very private person, actually. Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he? Straight-A brainiac! Could you guys possibly cool that for a - - See those guys? Technothugs. Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night. All right, then. You gotta kill yourself. I'll just go to Heaven. We're on vacation. I've got a ton of work and no good people. Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need. Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work. Where is she? Moved out. She moved out? Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright. Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live. Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise. Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound. Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir. As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship! What do your friends call you? Steph. Do you have a car, Steph? How'd you know it was me? I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in? I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful. Well, actually, she looks better than that. You're kidding -- Those comics -- They never got the eyes right. Ah, Mr Bean ... Excuse me. But he's got five times the man-power to draw on. We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones. Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger? That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett. Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week. Didn't I do it? Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear. Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak? May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do? I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak! Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt! Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due? End a April. Any others? This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time. That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course. Oh, yah, I know that! They can really take over, that's for sure. You have children? This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours? I guess so. Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much. Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next! You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud. Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement. Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested. It's certainly... dramatic. Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins. Is that why you got into this business? What do you think? Call upstairs, see what you can find out. Right. T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk. Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed! I didn't finish talking to you! Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram! I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it. ...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks... What did he do? I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here. Please go to no trouble. And it snuffled the ground like a dog. Like this. This is Captain McGann. Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries - We can't leave the piano Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased.... Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he? He's pretty laid back, confident. He remind you of that guy, Tillman? Not at all. But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again. I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles. Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it. My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it. You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack. Foley <i>kid</i>napped me. Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping. What did you do to the batteries? Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he? Hey Butt-Head it's that chick! Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score. Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else. You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates. And then? Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know. It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on. Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something? Coffee might be nice. As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you? Hanging on every word. Good joke.  Wanna hear another one? Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out? It looks that way, doesn't it? We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed. Are we hacking or asking? Yes. In that order. And what about you, anything? I want to live. I understand. These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm. So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding. I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon -- More antiques for your collection -- Cheers! Roper. What? Are you going to make this hard for me? Depends. What's up? There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up. Define concern. Now, or he dies, please. Come on, Alice. Could I see you a minute? Sure!  Excuse me. Orson, you wanna take five? Five...? Yes. No. We're done today He owned the water department? Yes. He owned the entire water supply for the city? Yes. How did they get it away from him? Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display. Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department. Along with Mr. Mulwray. They were partners. Yes. Yes, they were partners. The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out. Or teach it a better tune. Oh God! What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote? Goddamn you! I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up. But you're sure? He was at the campground yesterday. So... It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent? This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already. How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like? Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many -- What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too. Yes, I know. First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that? What? Assassinate somebody? No -- That's not Fred Madison? No, sir, it's not. Who is it? I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson? Yeah, Mack? Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here. It's all there. Spread it out. Mordechai. Do you love your mother? Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother. You're my handsome man. I'm a bad person. No.  No. No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up.... You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble -- --- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you. ...What time do you go to bed. Sir? You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed. Well... And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss. I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her. You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts... Whistler, I -- I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right. Jesus Holly, we got enough time. Okay, but I don't want to miss him. Follow that Budjovice sign. Lookin' to make the papers, John? Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle. You can't show intent. Okay. Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right? Okay. So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay. Good to know. Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon. Okay. Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything? Not right now, thanks. Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald? Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure. Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA? You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life. And Shaw? Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency. What about Ruby? Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games. Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong. I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night. Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now? Naw.  Those are for us. Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now? How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many? Oh, lots. Yeah, that's right. But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why? I see a rhetorical question on the horizon. I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver. Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way. Oh, please, Mike... Give me a break! No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it? In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations... Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here? I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone. But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you. He knows me? He says he saw you in a vision some time ago. Please.. You shouldn't laugh -- You see? Thea believes it, too! What brought this on? I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch. How many months are you? Two. What's wrong with her? Is she a friend of yours? No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot. Damn it! I didn't even see them fire! Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in. Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day? I don't let him.  He just loves to. What happened to you?  Who was that? That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division. Where's your car? I left it at work. You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried. Hello. This is Cheeba. I am Lieutenant Dunbar. What is your number? 105-353. That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men. I'll live. Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant? I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel. Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going. I'm okay here. Why bother? No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia. Ever try forty sleeping pills? Abfuehren! You two! You don't believe in curses, huh? No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe. I'll have the same. Of course. What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm? Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words. I know.  Me neither. They're beautiful. May I have one too please? No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible. It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise. I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you. Oh, my heavens! It's gone! Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually. What happened? That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run! What am I going to do now? Don't tell me your ticket was in it? No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it. You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville. Why, no I   Yes . . . I guess I will. I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean. No. I'd rather you didn't. Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name? I don't want it reported! Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that  See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her. Why, you ungrateful brat! Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich? Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager: What's the matter? Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula. I've seen all that a hundred times. Hey, will you just leave me alone? Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic. You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam. That's not the point. Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him. Got any more bread crust? Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city. Alexandretta. Now we know. Yes. Now we know. Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun. It's TV heaven. I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once. Let's try out the bed. I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried... You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got! Don't let's lose each other. Miriam... Shush. Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job? I'm not... You're not what? Qualified for anything else? I'm hungry I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you. I'm hungry. Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work? What am I gonna do? Listen, what's your name? Al. Speak up. Come on. Al. Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you. You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell. Shhhh...it's okay. Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold. Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God. I can't...I can't find a shelter You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry. You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim. I don't want to learn that! Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids? Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson. Actually, it's Mary Brooks now. Oh... are you... ? Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution. Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times? Time, Pilch! My move. No fair! You lured him with produce. Help me. How can I? I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette. We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over. Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you. You liked Sister Paul? She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful. What else did she tell you? She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. But first, a little juice.... And second? Mmmmmm. Wait a minute.  Promise me something. Anything.  Anything. That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them. You got it. So what are you up to now? I'm robbing this place. Hey Doc!  Come on now. Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything. Where are the keys to the motor home? On the dresser. Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front. Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt? I don't know, they just did. Take the binoculars. Wh-what do you think-- TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS! A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why? Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag. Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you. The Scimitar will serve my needs. But surely... I came this far alone ... There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box. No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe? I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead. Or someone has a nitrogenizer. A what? We can't reach that! We don't have a choice! Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you? No. Of course not. He wouldn't be. Who? John Doe. The one in there. Let's talk some more first. Right.  So!  In town on business? Uh-huh. Let me guess, you're a... lawyer. And why do you say that? I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look. Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword? I do as I please. Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out. Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%. You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on. ...Gordon. Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work. I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale? Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose. Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend? Had one.  Didn't work. What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her. Nope, I told her everything. And the truth frightened her? Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said. Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess? Photojournalist. Sure. What's this? What does it look like? How long have you had it? Years, why? It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this. You already have the checks, darling. I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry. Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me? Of course. How about your new friend? I told you she's just.. A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right? Right. In an hour, Larry. Hi, Byron. Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit! Neither have you, pard! How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on? We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes. How could you let this happen, General Schmuck? Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered. Then there's no chance for recall? I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all. Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it. But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen. That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little. How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak? Nicole? What, Mason? DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE! Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire! Mine! You guys have been so colossal... Do you have any witnesses, Major? What? What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you? Look, I didn't shoot him! We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major? Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command. Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected. Colonel, don't you know what's going on? Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper. Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs. You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk! Didn't they tell you? They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack. Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay? Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband. Ready, Uncle Lex? If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring. What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal. Of course you are. All right, Ed. What's her name? Miss Kubelik -- Fran. Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember? ...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion. Uh-huh. Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER! Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth? Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery. Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it. Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich. I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? Ugh ... Excuse me? Donnie? You're a dick. I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank. Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home. I have a better idea of where we can go. Ok. The right nostril.  Good. My right nostril? There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril. This conversation is making me a little sick. Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear. Hey, can we go to McDonald's? Absolutely. Well, it wasn't in the jar... Did it leave? Actually, I don't know... Oh shit! Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay? Okay. Good lad. So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice. That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it? What's that? Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba. And my permission? I'd like yours too. What? Nothing. No, tell me what's so funny. I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me. Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you. Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time. I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles. Why didn't you take it? The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy. You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that. At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about. You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller. Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer. A loan officer? That's right, a loan officer. So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you? Uh-huh. On screen... We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative... Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means? Carpe Diem... seize the day. Very good, Mr._? Meeks. Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines? Your name? Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player. Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night? Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth. Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy? Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air. It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time. Oh that's nice for you. Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay? Shoot. How old are you? Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October. Where did you go to school? Harvard. The Harvard Business School. Your address? Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building. Nice. Very nice. Thanks. Now we're going to have a fight, you and I. Are we. And I'm going to win. Don't be too sure. What? Go back to where you came from.  Or die here. Why would you let me go back? Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past. Toh-pak-cha=8A HoS qorDu. More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road. Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette. It s been interesting, that s for sure. But I ve done some good things too, haven t I? You ve been Jack Campbell.  And that s always a good thing... Why would I kill my husband? Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons. I loved him! He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury. Anything...A feeling...a smell..? Nothing! Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son? Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em. Hi. You going to ask me in? Oh that one there, in the corner. The one up on the third floor? Yes. Uh huh. What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package? I wouldn't touch that if I were you. What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke. Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat. I can't do this, honey. What? Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors. You moved into this block? Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you re not walking away! Oh, cut the crap! I just hate seeing you so stuck. He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure. You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn t one of them. Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks. Humpbacked - people.? Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece. Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight? You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them. Two? It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott. The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs - By killing them? By freeing them. I don't understand. The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed. Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa-- Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder. I have to go. Jody, wait. Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat. See y'at the Finish Line. Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me. Shaddup, Vito. Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for. You get paid to do what we say. Queen of diamonds. Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it. Albatross? Yeah. Rick March.  Who the hell are you? Gieg, Chuck. Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat. Whatever. Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons. So whattya say, kid?  You in or out? Kevin?  Do you not love me? No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special. But you don't love me. I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong. I have to cut his windpipe... You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him! What else should I do, damn it, he's dying! A lot's happened since we last saw each other. Yes. I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise". Thank you. I have to talk to you. Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse... I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in. Where's Positano? It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning... Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea. Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you. He tried to kill her first. Is Sid in therapy? I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter? He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport. Larry, did you rent a car? Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't. I understand. I'm just real curious like you said. I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business. It must be great. And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand. Animals that -- that eat straw? Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears. You did not just say "Injuns," Del. The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things. Like what? Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit! Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken. I... I don't know... Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please? My socks? They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual. It's an experiment. No. Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting. Yes -- ? Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert -- Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening. I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother. Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest? You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society. Perfect! Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties. Seems like a nice place. It is, if you like idiots... Yeah I can't. OH MY GOD. Look at that. ..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner... I don't like that story. But king Arthur was always your favorite. Can I ask you something? Shoot. What do you want to be when you grow up? We have a lot in common. You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there? Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet. Of course not. You could help us. I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league. If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down. My name is Taylor. Look at the size of those two beasts. I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer. The monster appears to be a genetic aberration... No fuckin' lie... ...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality... You fellas got names? Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there. Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper -- Please, if he sees you, he won't come! Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns? What about him? Yes. Did he come around often? Why the empty cage? That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan. So she's pretty cool, huh? Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested. No shit? Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say? My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one. What do you mean by sensible? It means being without money. Do you see what that means? Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder? You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh... Twenty seven hundred. Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it. Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here. I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor. Kelly.  Is Suzie there? Yes. Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down? Why can't you come... No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes... You know what it takes. Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay? Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute? I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door! Hey... Hey where are you going? We have no right to do this. They deserve to know. Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no! Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard. It's not about working hard -- Bullshit. -- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm. -- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it. People sure like those Misery books. I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books. Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks. Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange? I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels? Rob. Liz, hold on a second --  What? Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now! Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno. He had a pressing engagement. Philistine. I got a problem... All your money's in Mexico. I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children. No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess. Y'know, I'm sort of psychic. Yeah? Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff? I don't know. Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know? Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know. Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right? Yeah, I guess. But I think I am. I like to think I am. It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you? Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say. Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have. I think about that. What's funny about that? You know me, boy. You've... done... this... before. I've had some practice. I can't reach her. What do you see? Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait. Artie! Calm down! Calm down! No, I won't calm down! He's my husband! Stay out of the way! Artie! Artie! We can't help him if - I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ... He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev. ... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America. B.B. It's me   Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year? I didn't see you. What do you mean? You haven't heard? Andy's dead. Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman. Lonnegan. I was getting to it. Getting to what? The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative -- I fail to see -- Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects. Delayed after-eff-- I want you to see him immediately. Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear? Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight. I beg you.  You can't do this to me. I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty. Then show some.  They'll shut me down! It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences". I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter. Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed. I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment -- Let me help you. Swann?  What are you doing? Binding you. Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you? My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you. How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on? Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively. Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school. You're Woogie? Yes, Billy? I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does. I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you? It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be. It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle. Nah. It's a scratch. Okay -- Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Already. Greed.  It was written in blood. It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it? Look fella...this is private... Nothing's private... Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are. Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys. What? You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old. You're right. I didn't tell you that. Hey, Frank. You recognized me. Just a lucky guess. So what do you think? Very realistic. Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big? Thank you, John. You're welcome, Grace. You're not from around here, are you? Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package? You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day. I just drove in this morning. Drove into Sierra?  What for? Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road. Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure. Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert. Least you can leave. Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take. And here I've made you all hot and sweaty. Your life? Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick. Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it. Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way. Jesus, Lenny. Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her. Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love. Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil. That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it? Committed? Committed. So does that mean that you sleep here every night? Yes, it does. Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room. Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium? I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them. You scared me. Sorry.  You okay? I'm fine. Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want. Do you know? What is this? A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything? What color are my shoes? You have feet? ... You got a glass? It's the least I can do. Okay... a quick one, sure... <u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy. Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked. I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo- -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo- -careful, Abdullah- You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room. I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money. You're somewhere else, where? Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this. Uh-huh. And? You're right, you know. We don't have much time. Besides, Dad would have freaked. No, he wouldn't. I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing. That's not true. Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is. Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been? I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location. We can't shoot the Old Mill. You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy... Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months. Here is now there. There is here. It went great in Mississippi, Mike. Good. Ray, run faster. Okay. Actually, I find it all fascinating. And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station? Yes, father. Is it true? Wallace is captured? Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation. When will his trial be? Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed. The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else. I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me! That's the hard part. I must be going nuts... Nancy? Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic. We ought to be suing him. I'm going back to the hotel. Good. See you next weekend? As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due. No I ain't. Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237? Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out! About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too. Well... Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end. Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage. Yes, he does.  May I try? The guests are here. Guests? Just like you always wanted. What about the Powwow Safe? What? The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money. Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe. What do you want from me? I did what you said. Letting him use your toilet? No store does that. He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up. I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood. Anthony, Daddy's busy. This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami. I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola? Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute. Then you must be at least 70 years old. At least. That's impossible. Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but -- No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here! Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please! We're renegades from despair. Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry? Absolutely. Why'd you want to help us? Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me. Now you get up! And you get in my house! Or what? I have to go home, Sanchez. Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time. We're family, Caesar. No! Gimme the gun. I can't.  I can't. Give it to me. He was accused of jury tampering. Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks. Four cases in three years ... The man's an ambulance chaser ... ... tell me about this case. This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court. No -- we don't want this case in court. Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff. I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed. No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not. So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me. All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial. Good good, then it's all settled. A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives. He doesn't look fifty. Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago. What are you doing? He has no heartbeat! You're hurting him!! I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once. ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!! LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD! Yeah? Hi, Rob.  It's your mother. Where can we meet? Know the Millertown bluff? If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive. Keep talking, there won't be a next time. Yes. I was a friend of Harry Lime. I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers... Or socks. Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect. Cause I know about getting' them half-centses? Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total? Ninety-three, including the sauna. Take any three you like. After you get settled we can... I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules. Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position. No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this? Nothing; Barnett. It's my job. Your job, huh. He's probably been waiting all night at the station. C'mon. Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay? That's okay. It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office... That's okay... I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass... End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared. My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose. What was that all about? You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny. More like Jenny is after every man she sees. Bought it. It's not your taste. What did she say the down payment was? She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one. She took you shopping for a tie? I had to follow her to a store. What's wrong with your paisley tie? Ellie, it was a formal party... Excuse me!  You went to a party with her? I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit... I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you? She bought it. Why? I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie? I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup! Vietnam! Goodnight, John. Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father? Yes. Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends. My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer. Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried. But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired? Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation. That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well. Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you... Now -- er -- Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness... Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet. That was lovely! You know you almost got us both Killed back there? Fun though, wasn't it? You'd die for fun? Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed. I laugh sometimes Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy? Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean. You're a little touchy about it. I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy? Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife? What about her? Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life? Where do you get these questions? Just answer. I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know. Doesn't suit you. How would you know? Just doesn't, that's all. Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven? Room service. The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out. We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ? Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down. Shot himself. What for ? Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ? When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out! Shelby! Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea? No, thanks. Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something? That's very kind of you. Are you related to him? No, I'm his housekeeper. Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living? He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry. Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing. Okay. We all have... I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again. Tell me something, Skid -- Scud. Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger? The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump. Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping. Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower. And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change. Where is she? Takin' a bath. Any I.D.? Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case. Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair. Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.     I am the demon from the bottomless pit... ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977. I am impressed. For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. Who said that? Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7? He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite. You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo. That's right. No, you didn't, Frank. Okay, that's no problem. That's exactly what you said last week. Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!! The stewardess let me keep my headphones. That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!! Where are you going, Sebastian? Just thought I'd... No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together. And I'll bring my entourage... Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30. Said. Oh my God... I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country. What happened? Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really... -- what the hell is that? What? That silly-ass look on your face. I was being polite. Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment. Oh, by the way what's your name? What's that? Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan? Calloway. That's too far ahead to plan. Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train? Oh, darling! I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner. This won't take long. Promise? If you bring the caramels. Sheila... Stop... FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! What about our grenades? Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades. Would they notice and eighty-eight? Sure, you got one? The Germans do. My father must've been amazing. He was in a league of his own. Now I become custody of police department? If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation. I will if they don't send me back. They won't until this is over. You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for? The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson! Well, uh, can you tell us his name? Jeez, I didn't catch it. I hate both parties. And I'm a Republican. It will be a hard break. She's young. She'll get over it. I wasn't thinking of Pinta. Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now... I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps... The most important thing. Is being together. These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat. How many shots you say you heard? Four to six. That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say. ...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination. No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it? We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear? I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital. It's gone.  I feel it! So do I! I'm sick. Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding. No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No! My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school. God. The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that. Does it still hurt? Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down. Ellie, what is it? I'm sorry -- I can't -- What? I can't do this -- What are you so afraid of? Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now -- What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never? Please -- I'm in love with you, Ellie. Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow -- And then what?  Then you'll be safe? -- I don't know -- Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose? I can't hear this now -- Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone. And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please. Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside? Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you! Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy! Do you have any ice tea? Sure. Come on in. Just rolled them up and threw them in. Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime. Extraordinarily lucky. Are we here? Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child. What do I do? Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb. Okay - got light duty, three days. Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway. What you got there - beers? Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man. Why are the police taking this all so seriously? It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory? Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low. I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?! It's all the same thing. Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back? Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable. What will he do?  What does he want? He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering. What can we do? Who?  Who?  Who? Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you! Who, Ray? Dana!  Dana Barrett! Can't. You said you weren't always impotent. That's correct. So you have had sex. Yes. Who was the last person you had sex with? Her name was Elizabeth. So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off? No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem. What was the problem? The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering". So you lied to her? Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly. How come? I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions. And now you can? Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me. Don't you get lonely? How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy? I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong. Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him? Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out. If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited? I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no... Subtlety? Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself. And you feel the same way with John? Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables. Interesting analogy. I'm babbling. No, you're not. God, I m so mad at him!! You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia. Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!! You know I thought you'd left me back there. What are you talking about? Brief marriage!  Ten years! Was he in love? He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides - What's that, Dad? That's the Air Force Base. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh!  Well, what happened to you? They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there! Well, that's you all over. What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what? Cunnilingus? Stop. Goosed! Give me the Valium. Miss Scott, you're not making any sense. I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out! For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante. Me! If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up. The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ? Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money. May I help you? Peter Kelson? Yes... and you are? I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant. Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party? What made you pull out that old thing? I was thinking of you. And? It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young. Maybe I should read it. Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady. Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS? Okay, give me the numbers. Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there. The dishes are juiced up, too. Thank God. Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts. They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own. He doesn't know about the Day Care. Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf? Yeah, that's old, in a tree. Oh. Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it? Just put some mustard on it and eat it. You didn't get ketchup? Gimme that damn thing. Is this a good spot? I'm not burying him here... Why not? There's a better place... Bastard. Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist... I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are. You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant - I always wanted to try that. Only don't try putting words in my mouth. It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports. No.  I mean it, thank you. Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot... Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while. Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works. Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342. I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water... A Maker's Mark, please. Up. No. you're right. I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered. Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much. Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins? Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary. I was just going to! Where I'm at is maybe 1890. Say again? Make that 1790. It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc  saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man. That's the bad blood between you and Johnny? That's it. But that wasn't Johnny's fault. I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget? Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off. Are you quite sure? Yes, really, thank you very much. You see? Yes. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. You make it sound like I'm already dead. I like you, Baron. I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin. Life signs? Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg. Snap out of it, bomb. In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void. Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute. Where the hell is he? Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ... So ... let's go ... He told me to take you to his conference room. No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged. Then his office will be fine. Who did you hear it from? I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri? You know what? I m not having this conversation right now. Sure, disappear. We ve been walking away our whole lives. A horseshoer? Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army. I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks. With Salvy, eh? I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve. I understand she is now the understudy in there. Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin. So we have a bit of a problem, don't we? Er well, yes we do. In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you? ...<u>sadly</u>... Hey, lost again. But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution. I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... The great and <u>beautiful</u>... Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that... No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle. Thank you. Or clear your windshield with it. ...what a lovely perfume. Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there... It's for my daughter. How old is she? Four. Oh, she'll love it. Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't? No. What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again? Are you two okay? We've been better. What's going on? Michael Myers. Who's that? 10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle. You sent for me. I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar. You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk. Caesar wants me to stay. Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay? Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point. Hunh. How are things in Moscow? Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians. At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell. Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear. Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here. Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head. How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck Liz left us, Red. Take the hint. We don't take hints. It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice. Do you want to come in? No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along. Mr. Gilroy -- I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her. Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles. -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand -- -- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back. Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you -- How much wine have you had? -- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you. You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again? No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone! The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface. Sabotage? A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air. Martini! Your buddy is callin' ya. Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay? This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop. You can help us. What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down. If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason. I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say! So tell me when I ain't done it. How can I trust you when you look at me like that? You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes. Tell me, Charlie. Please. Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way. How did you do that? Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you. Of what? They're watching you, Neo. Who is? Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him. We got the press this time! And we got the "big mo"!  We're back! Do you... remember me? I've seen you before.  Your picture... I've got one favor to ask. What can I do for you, George? I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me. Fundamentals? Sure.  Unsnap my stockings. It's Merle, Sal. Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know? I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind. Merle gave me this? Yeah. But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this? I want you to look at this. What is it? It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage. What's Hinckley Cold Storage? Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it. I'm staying. How did you know Speck was a killer? The little piggie speaks. Which ones?  I bring them all. Luminal. You have warp capability? Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...? Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour? I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you! Tell me what? I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship! Now, Bobby, just a minute-- Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around! Bobby, you've been dreaming again. No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it! Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name? Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy. Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner. Alright. Good luck, yourself. Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me. No, I don't mind. All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl. A girl? Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it. Esther! Mordechai! I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl. Points very straight to her. He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes-- What does he see? Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clich s, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it? Very ridiculous. That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry. What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much? They call me Jeff. Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with? Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag. Looking for peanuts, I suppose. So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it. I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears. Time's up.  I'm off the case. They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind. That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself. Because you think your in love with me? I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules. <u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things? I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much. And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody? We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out. You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave? All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you. If I talk to you, I will miss my ship. Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George. And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off. Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand. Awwwww! Am I a member of this club? You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio-- Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. Everything O.K.? Just what the doctor ordered. Would you like a tour? Sure. Waitaminute - You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys. You can't do this - Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn - Hang on there - - and share one of your graves. You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself! Dr. Monnitoff? Donnie. I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel? Coffin? Mr. Lime's.  Accident... I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts. I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it. You sure? I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass. That musta messed 'em up pretty bad. What happened to 'em after that, Willie? It's okay. Smile, little sister, smile. Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis - It's probably wrong -- -- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time - The evidence was very meager -- You didn't think so then. That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy. How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape - She makes ten. Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women. What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times. You've been working in that video shop too long. And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork. No, what's wrong? You mind if I come in, check things? You really came back for more?  Of this? When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell... If you got a good one, Wick... Yes. Thank you. What? What do you mean, "what? What are you snickering about? I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy. What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about? He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain. Dr. Winkel told me that. Dr. Winkel? Who is he? The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened. His own doctor? Yes. Were you at the inquest? Who were you talking to? Sixpack... How is he? Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room... So how are you? Oh, me, I'm okay. Do you miss Frederick? No. I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know-- How are you? I'm okay. You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot. Y-yeah. She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer. What did she say about me? I think she covered you with the parasites. We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible... None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design. You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer. How long do we have to watch him? Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind. You wanna dance? I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before. And? No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it. You're no good at this, Jimmy. I'm sorry. You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl? Eh, don't take out me lines. I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here   I made this for you. Thanks.  Your dad called again   something about a job. Miss Daniels? Is that you? Yes. Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat? Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today. Got a smoke? You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake. The name's Plissken. Animal, I can't. Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance. Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for? It was a gift... from my brother. How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience. Who do you think did it -- Gideon? Maybe. Or Tex? Maybe. You're a big help. Can I have one of those? It's too soon for him. Can we talk about this in private? Lemme fix you a drink. No thanks, Birdie. He even played golf with the President. On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . . But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers. Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen. You know... How about the "Hell Merchants"? I don't like horror movies! How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles. I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals. Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands... Got any Ethel Merman? He is your husband, no? Yes, but...  He was having an affair. Si. We can't stop! They've tricked us. What's the crazy man saying, Lord? The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them. Who would do such a thing? Exactly. You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. Interesting theory. What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product. Child pornography. There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one. Snuff films. I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing. What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see? First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is. Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama? Soon. Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return. No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly. Jesus, what kinda broad are you? When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part. Bowling police, step back, give him room. Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball. When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since. And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb. And you struck him right here in our house ? Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man. ...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame? ...Both maybe? I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . . Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . . Tommy, let's put the tape on. Now? Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing. Fuck, OK. Tell me what's wrong. Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me. How can I help you with the particles? It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis. Henry's got our orders! We're going home! When? Any time. Whenever we want. Be right with you. Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up. Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey? I'm afraid to let her in the house. Oh, you are... I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff. Let me in the house! Fucker! ...ixed itself. Machines don't fix themselves. ... fix themselves. He's tampered with it, Dowser. ...ampered. with it, Spoor. So you think the dissertation will get published? I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny. No... Why?... Should I? Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had. ...What? There's something I have to tell you... You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset. Upset?  Why should I be upset? Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it. I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger. Perhaps the fall... There's one other thing. I feel.. What? ...Afraid. Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man. ...A bat. What? I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred. No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them. Now don't fuss, Paul. Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you? At-at-at-at-at. Knock it off! Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts. Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing? I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. No you're not. Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour. Where are my goddamn books? Books? My journals! Where are they? Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together. Supposin' he don't go to the ranch? I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch. I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back. Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear? What's it add up to you, Sefton? It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy. I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere. Up-tighteous and self-righteous. Then what? Vanished. Thin air. It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully. Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'? You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you. I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work. Then try again, Jesus... Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge. We can't do that, Bobby. Good night, papa. Good night, my little darling. Papa? Yes? One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa? What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story? If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive. Keep talking, there won't be a next time. Whose death? It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks. Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression? Aw, nerts! She'll come back. No, she won't. Why would you let her to do that? It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me. You fucking bastard... Whose side are you on? Why not? Can you? Sure I can, can't I? Oh, joy. Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source. Are we going to ever see your father? My father. Yeah. He lives here, right? He does. You look at them? How? The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools. Naw! That's science fiction stuff! Not where we operate. Goddamnit!  How many times I told you -- We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW. That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night! But -- How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it. What are you doing here? Mickey told me to come back to work. We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad. Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries. Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>. It'll have to wait. Come on. Meanwhile, what happens to the country? The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft. I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail. Less ten percent. Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note. 212  CONTINUED: Keep back. Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is? Mrs. Thorwald. ...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...? I know it well. <u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean? It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence. Father Barry. Hello, Edie. I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night. You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar? Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word. Very well. You want me to wait? No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home. I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you? I don't know. That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning! ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him... Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running! Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson? Okay? Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo. Excuse me, Agent Mackelway? This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero. Is she dying? She's having a baby. Twins. Es impossible. You can trust me on this one. It's a miracle. You gonna do what I say, got it? Yes. I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! What was that bang? We must have a blow-out. Oh... Is Mr Greenleaf here? Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron. What if every country legalized at the same time? Somehow, I don't see that happening. I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties. Things are quite serious, I should say. We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense. What do you have in mind? To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea. Are you serious? I don't even know whether a defense is possible. What forces do you have at your disposal? About 5,000 troops. Cavalry? The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers. Any cannon? There are none here. Where are they? Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons. You could have them here by daybreak. Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men? Properly arranged, yes. These are odds of 8 to 1. The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant. Would you be prepared to handle this for me? Are you proposing to transfer command to me? In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command. Fair enough. I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses. I'm not insulted. You realize what is at stake? Our lives, the revolution, my career? Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now. Hello. You looking for some action? Well... I guess so. All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here. This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing: It's ok. If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that. No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it. And what is the second thing? Well I guess this is it. I won't be needing these anymore. I got to get home. Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you. I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with. And after all, you have such morals. I got delayed. I -- Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean... ...Well then, that's how many I killed. If you say so. Damn right I do. hound of resurrection -- See? I don't like that -- -- Hound of resurrection? Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair. Tell 'er to go to hell anyway! And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery. What for? Lobotomy! Lobotomy? That! How romantic. We think so. Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak. Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down. No speech? No speech. I love you, my little Leonitchka! And I adore you, Ninotchua. Where's that Deputy? Be here in a minute. Hey! What the  --  ! You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it. Test it. How many? Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded. Jesus Christ! One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph. Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon. You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are. Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you. Some men are here.  They asked for you. I'm not here. That's what I told them. Good. They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away. I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want. And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck. Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms? No. Oh, Peter. It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya... Is he out? Like the Rock of Gibraltar. How's the weather out there? Little chilly. Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today! Doc -- something you said the other day -- Yes? It doesn't jibe with this    you told me the leopard would go out into the country  - it wouldn't stay in the city    Sure -- certainly  - but what's that got to do with this? That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt. Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings. Why? It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey. But it doesn't eat what it kills. Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question. What? Never mind, just say it.  Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner. Just until he heals up? Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey. How can we get in touch with them? In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now  ...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day... I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for? Fight fair, son...Use your fists! Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone... What would you like, beer? No, just a coffee. One beer, one coffee, thanks. I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die? What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now. My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it? Two o'clock. Where's my dress? I have to go home. Oh, it's a fire hydrant. Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present. And some people need their medication tweaked. I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier. Don't you go to school? Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch. Make the call. She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright. She's got my word. She's gonna want to hear for herself. You know him? No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before Shit. What?  What, that guy? This was World War I? No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had -- Company outing or picnic or something like that. Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all. Laura? Donna, are you my best friend? Of course... What's in there? A little bunny I saved from dissection. Harry! To our assignment. What is it you need me to do? Helen, I want you to be my wife. I'm married! Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone. We're going to Paris? Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days. I don't know.  I have to think... Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable. Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here? I don't know... I think he went out the back. Can I look for myself? Who are you? I'm the Bowler. Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie! They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it. Donut? No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing? I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico. I knew I could count on you. I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean? Oh, thank you. Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him. You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go. How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers. Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all. Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle? No one live there. Well, who is your lord? We don't have a lord. What? Okay.  Great line at the end. Did you shoot their boots? Of course. We can cut back at the end. To the pan of the supplies boxes -- Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups. You're already gettin' psychological input, son. Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads. What's your name, man? They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge. Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job? That's right. Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally. So? This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out. Just like that, eh? Just like that. Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me. ...Oh, Jesus. ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave? That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann. Mm. Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife! Let's go. I thought you were enjoying yourself? Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon. You're crazy! It's freezing out there. All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines. You are Panda, monarch of modems. That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me. Okay... let's say that, for now. It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour? My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy. They're beautiful ... Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at. I don't. YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON . It's early.  Why do we have to go home? Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe. I'll hitch. Oh, no, you won't. But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King? So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection? It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be. Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France. What's his name? Fumitsu. Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind. I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy. No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay? This isn't our area. Whose area is this -- Can anybody hear me! Don't worry. We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west. No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here. I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor. I doubt that it matters any more. I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud. Tell her how you don't sleep at night. He's not responsive -- Ben!  Ben! Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf. Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir. I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf... ML? What? ML, hold this for me. It's just us now. I know. Never was anybody like you... You can't take anything seriously. You're right. Away. From you. But why? Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said. I sort of like what you said. That makes it worse. But I don't understand. Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time? What are you driving at, boss? We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records... What about Spock? I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is -- What I have done, I had to do. But at what cost? Your ship... Your son. If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul. I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met. I am the son of Annikin Starkiller. We've got to help each other. Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him. It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything. I can't do it anymore. Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody. I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out. Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it. I don't want to hear about her anymore. Never. Tell me, did he kill his little victims too? No! Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta. Why? Cuz I want New York. Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore    House. You in the market Duke? I done my shopping in Seoul last night. Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...? Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things... No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did. But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that. I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean. Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears... Well, I guess we won't be going to church today. I guess we won't. No. Why not? You got everything you need? If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy. It is something really important, Jeff? I'm afraid it is, Tess. I'll have him call the moment I hear from him. Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight. Who's Thorwald? He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man. Goodnight, you idiot. Goodnight, Mrs Doyle. It's Cochrane. I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship. We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today. There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us? Well, we could-- There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans. I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>. I have lava. Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that. I can't do that? Do what? Let you leave without it. Without what? And mine's Conway. How do you do? You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction  Well? Well, what? Have you decided? All I said was that it sounds like a good idea. Get out of here -- I'm not leaving without you. You don't understand. The Thirst -- Have you talked to Eric? I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron? I was hoping you had some news -- Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in... Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock. DO YOU WANNA DIE?! No. Yes you do... Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars. That's what we thought. Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through? Done it already.  Nothing matches. Yo, Paulie. Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror. Yo, Paulie. What? Your sister's givin' me the shoulder. Forget her. You could do better than my sister. Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me. Looks, huh? Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister? My sister's a friggin' loser. Hey -- Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor. Don't get mental, man. Ya caught me in a bad mood. Ya always in a bad mood -- ...Adrian ain't sharp. I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter. And where is she? She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here. So, you come here all by yourself? Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ... ... Oh ... ... And the children thought I should take a trip. Yeah. I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from? Moscow. Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village? Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole. You mean it's dangerous? Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day. Get on. Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that. Get on! Hello, Brad - Emily - Where you headed, Betty? Los Angeles, California. And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy. Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas. I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went. Did you love it? Sure I loved it! It was great. No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant. Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps? Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to... Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and... No. Don't be silly. It's just... I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now? Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married? No. Family? No. A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment. I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment. Think you can get me any of that? Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony. Mine's the Eleventh. But... he only wrote nine, Major. I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too? No. Ours was damaged. What's in those files? The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtw ngler? You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven. Is this Hell? Or just Hell-adjacent... Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean? It means nothing. What, Howard? We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later. A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face. We must sue for peace. Peace?! We cannot defeat this -- With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen! It is suicide. Saw that one. What would you call it? Now, that was a look. What? I've no fucking cigarettes. I want to drive awhile. I ain't tired yet. Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls. Whaddya mean, buy? Pros. It's kinda money, actually. Make someone bleed. No, man, we're in the play-offs. You got something to say? I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave. Fuckin' A. Come on. We're gonna be okay. Did you get help? Is it an ongoing case? For months... last October. It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her. How do you know that? He felt remorse.  He covered her. I tell you - this is the only way to travel. You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing. No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party. I may spill something. So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party. What's the surprise? Uh-uh.  Not yet. When? We better have a drink first. Here.  This'll put hair on your chest. No fair guessing. Hey, Scooby! How's it going? Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here? I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions? I'll be your guest! Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look. Let me call you a car, Linda. Shut the fuck up. I will follow you. Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, No bodies, no West... No death certificates. No crime. Do you love your father? Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy. Do you love him? Benjamin, I want to ask you something. What? Will you take me home? What? My husband took the car. Will you drive me home? Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle... ... no uncoded messages on an open channel... I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things. Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage. Now, Holly's not shy. You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ? Something like that - Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ... Does wood sink in water? No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond. Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water? Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ... Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up! Yeah, what's up? Shhhh. See ya around the ball park. I'll settle for a third of that. And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that? True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl? I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin? Dante's Inferno. Yeah.  The Inferno. What's... Blair.  He's gone berserk. You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted. As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice? A-14. Miss. Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults? I've had a gutful of this. If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody. Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business. This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this? That will be just about enough! Now get out of here! I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you. Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd. Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal... <u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads... How're your hands? Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing. You know, that night, I ... It just all came up. Yeah, I know.  Me, too. I mean, you can play.  You're okay. I can keep the beat. Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that. Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship. Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even... You have ten seconds. All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up. Is that a cellar door? Yeah... I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide. I'm not hiding. I'm right here. You killed Lauren! You killed her! Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes... Try not to sweat? My number two. Special assignments. She's -- Let me guess -- 'Father'? You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one... Shut up. Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered. Shut your mouth and drive! Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ? What's ailing that dog? I dunno. Well ... make him keep quiet. And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think. Hush up such talk, Jabez! I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing! Such a joker!  Like your father. No.  Have a look. Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail! What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing. Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway. You're in Oklahoma?! Not yet. Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to. Can't it go to any office? No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code. The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting... Why'd call me a killer? Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed. You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you. Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job. Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!... ...junk! Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and -- Quiet! Ohhhhhh! Hey!  Wow! What?  What is it? Woody!  Buzz! Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they? Here!  In the car! See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them. You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through? It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again. But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir. Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis. Greta, come on.  One burger with me? Why do they switch the r's and l's here? I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright". Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun. Ok, whatever you want. Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi? No, I was looking at you. Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road... I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix. Oh, for her show? No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show. Oh. You're possessive. I know. Sir, please try to hold still. So, I guess it worked. Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon. She was playing with my Pooh doll again... I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this. May I have a look? Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?. We get it. We're sorry. Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears. Not leftovers? No -- real food. Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move. I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he? Where are we going ? The Brooklyn Bridge. Do you remember the legend of the young man? A faithful heart makes wishes come true. Make a wish, Lo. Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh. No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here. Oh my lady, my love! If they find you here they will kill you. You can bring them with a word. Oh, not for the world! Will you defy your father and your Queen? The Queen has consented? She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief. I will do my duty, my lord. Thorfinn! You can't die! I'm not frightened... of anything... You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla! No... he's not... not... there... Tell him I'm coming! Feds asked for me? They asked for the best street man I had. It s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I m the victim. Please, Cotton, don t do this. What do you want? Why are you here? I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door -- He's not my boyfriend. I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business? I have nothing more to say. When do we take the tests? Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening. What's that you say? The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two. I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him -- What? Gray -- I'm rid of him -- Yeah, she looks all right from here. Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress. I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute. Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here. I've you to look after me, haven't I? Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying? Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen. I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both. Oh no. ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over? No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times... The obituary column? You'll find one of those people. Those people?' Miss Sessions. Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us? No thanks.  Sounds good though. Suit yourself. I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care. Talk from there.  You can talk from there. In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones. Don't even start. You want to hear me out? You can't be serious. That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us. You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal. There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises. There's always a surprise. I've covered everything. And you're the best, so-- You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me. Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times. For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump. Feeling old? -- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry. Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum. I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff. I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff. I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues. Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours? Guess. Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers? Yeah... Freddy Krueger. Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary. The first one was, but the rest sucked. So, you gotta boyfriend? Why? You wanna ask me out? Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend? No. You never told me your name. Fucking Zombie. The scar. There is no scar. I'm telling you. No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you? Well... Hello. Hey. It's me. Where are you? We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late. How late? No. Just like an hour or so. What about the chairs? Okay. What okay? What! The chairs. I left a message. I think it's going to be okay. You sound funny. Did you do cocaine? No. No. I'll see you in about four hours. Reggie -- please believe me! No! My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric. I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two. So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer? A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....? Permant cortex bond. Correct. Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody? I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me... Another 'you'? Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted. Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me! What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore. Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have... Why not call for help? For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this. Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize. What did you find, Dad? Me?... Illumination. They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed. We didn't miss anything. Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it. He's tanking on us... So? We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group. She isn't that old. What do you mean? I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty. So he popped the pane? Bingo. Couldn't make much of it myself. I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you? Sure.  You think there's a connection? Maybe. He seeks redemption. You're a fool! Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King. So what has changed? Perhaps he serves a different king. With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want. I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else. Fine. Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control? Yes, Joe. When did this happen? A long time ago. General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation? We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory... Yes, what else? Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively. I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean? Yeah, you bet! Bernie. Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will. Where is my rascal, Lazlo? I will let down the steps for your honor. Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination. So where are you now? Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court. Shit. Get this! He called and invited me to dinner. And are the police aware you dated the victim? What are you saying? That I killed her or something? It would certainly improve your high school Q. You never told me how your parents met. They met at Auburn. What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that. That's because most of it never happened. But it's romantic. What the hell? Yoo hoo, bomb... Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood. You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons. He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning. That was nice of you. I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop. I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested  in pigeons. I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park. The things that go on. How do you like that one? Oh she's a beauty. Right. Then it's a deal. Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard. We'd be the first! J.J., if you think - Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now... Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay? Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie. He asked me to marry him. Very romantic setting. It was romantic.   He's very romantic. So are you engaged, or what? And you're sure it was a woman? God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know. Oww, the arm, the arm! You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!! One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!! That's right, you have the right to remain silent. What did he say? I'll never tell. Howdy! Howdy to you. But nobody had to take care of Nicky. You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you. I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him. Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds. I work in a bakery. You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed? Count 'em on one hand. It's almost like a conspiracy, huh? No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it. It's not worth it. You'll never win. You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh? I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery! GO POWER RANGERS! She hasn't actually done anything... Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me? Here. Don't even thank me. I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars. I simply don't have it, Joe. Get outta my way. You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there. These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go? I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon. You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't. I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense. I do love a good check mate. What do you want? Come with me and I'll let her live. You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here. What an awful sound! Get used to it.  Back door, Paul. It's ONE of these. We're going to freeze to death. O.K. O.K. I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand. Hurry up. Yes? Were you recently in the bathroom? What on earth gave you that idea? The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ... You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want? When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly? You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you. What will happen if I do? Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like. ...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows. Oh... My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name? David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better. Let me see it... I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me? Sure, Lana, I'd love to. ... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go. Can you try? I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone. And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it? Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with. You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure? Do you love your parents? I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine. Did you love him? Yes.  Very much. Prove it. I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way. You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner. I can imagine. Can you?  I couldn't. I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors. Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson. You've heard of me? Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote. What report? Huh? What report? You mean you don't know? Know what? William. Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call. Is this how it went, Nick? Robert?  Robert? I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because -- -- it was a betrayal. Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just... So what happened? I told you.  Nothing -- At the top of the Empire State Building -- I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here. Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it? How can you still believe she's innocent? You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing. And you know this for a fact? Did you see the icky black color of her hair? So? I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund. ... You got a glass? It's the least I can do. Okay... a quick one, sure... What? Can I trust you, Sami? Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room? If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing. No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead. You haven't answered my question. Does it really matter what I say? I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today. I will. You better. I'm not here very much. Business keeps you on the road? Something like that. ... And stay outta here. You have a T.V.? No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V... I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years. That when you stopped being a nurse? He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please. I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I... Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him. From what? From what? Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law... No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia. You talked about it? No.  I saw it on his face. Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy? Sandra Sinclair. Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up. Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist. I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her. You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already! Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose. And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right! Hello, Leon darling! Hello. After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia. Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer? Right here Frank. You want me to pour it? No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer. There ya go. Good, let's drink up. You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside. Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'. Map is kinda dirty, Monster... They changed the layout. Patience, Willow. Courage, Willow. What? Come on.  Ease off the girl. Good work.  Really. This is Colonel Richards. Nice to finally meet you, sir. What about bears? What about them? They could eat you. Yeah, they could. I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him. I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser. All right, then. I'll play him with my own money. You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ? Something like that - Motorcycle. Got it. You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he? No, he didn't. Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got. No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. I'm sorry.  Which hospital? I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it. Do what? What'd you do? How did you know we'd come here? It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous. Aye, but I still wonder how much. I want it -- But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much? Hello. How you doin'? My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time. Modred! Impossible! He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner. Expensive hangover. A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business. Knock it off! May as well go out under my own free will, right? Not with us in the fuckin' car! Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold. How are we going to get out there? I see. ...I know this must look... funny. No, no   What kind of trouble? It's not closing, Mike. That's impossible. I know.  But we show it's not closing. Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it. Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state. ... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ... I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE -- We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin. I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial. You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done-- Looks all right  He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American! I wish he had a family, though. It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun. No, I'm not. Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency! Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player? Don't be such a baby. I can't take him. You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ... ... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ... ... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ... Lasher touched you and you loved it. It wes a dream...! Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile! Stop it! Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are. ENOUGH!!! I don't think that bit's right. What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler? Would you have called her? Who? Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite? I don't know. What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much? I only owe you a ride, Vincent. It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think. Who are you? Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian? Yes. Friedman s the fuckin  Austrian! Where is he? I don t know. He s gone!  He s gone. I don t fucking know where, I swear... He s gone. On holiday... ...On holiday? Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees... Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each. How could that be?  The box was packed! Moe's terms. I have some change! Ram it up your ass! Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory. By all means. A movie *outside*? Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout. People watched the movies in their cars? When they watched at all. Do you like movies? Yes! I've only seen one, though. I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing. He didn't do you a favor. Screw you! I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece. That's good money. Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million. Then what? I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending. I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking. You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print. Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything. You're a great kid. Don't you forget it. Kincaid -- we should find the others first... YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER! What's the matter? It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out. Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip. You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here. Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do? Have lunch. Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle... I'll be back before you can say souffle. Shit!  Shit!  Shit! It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up. Hello. Yeah... Well... How you doing? I can trust my brain. That seems like a good choice. I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you. The two might go together. See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now. Cute. You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay? Lots of things... Tell me. Don't hit the face! Not the face!! Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now! Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break. Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb. Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs. Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me. This conversation is finished. You said we could go to New York. Did not. Did too. I can't know what I said, but we're not going. I'm not leaving this room until you say yes. Get out. No. Goddammit, I am sick of this -- Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool. I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious. I wonder if we ought to-- Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight. You think it's all right for you to stay here? I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight. Where we going? I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here. Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel? Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare.. Leeloo.. Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives. Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz. Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,. All of which he's now missin'. Well, some of his throat was there. Physician, heal thyself. Good luck with no fuckin' head. Anyway. Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc. Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description? But, you know, with the head still on. You're okay, though, huh? I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you? Oh, I'm fine. What...what about your script?  So what's it about? Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion. You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing. See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes. Must be. And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared. When are you going to stop treating me like one! When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you... How do you know?  Did you take his temperature? You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady. Look she's upset -- No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh... Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did. Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized. If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about. Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl. How did you find out? I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town. Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her? Just find the girl. I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves. Avocado groves? We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross. A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville -- -- Tuscarora -- All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago. ..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here! Who are you talking to Jack? YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!! Bingo! You think we'll go for that last place? Maybe, or you gotta know now. Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing. Shelly: get in the office. I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...? Why? Why have you done this to my friend? He doubts me. How. You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over. My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses! Ooh-kay... BENJAMIN? Yes. Will you bring up my purse before you go? I have to go now. I'm sorry. George?  What do you know about cocaine? I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive. No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty. This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.? Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care. We can't just... Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back. I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive. You and me both. Are you absolutely sure? I've seen the manuscript. Where? Never mind. Will these boards hold? The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts. Good. No Turks. We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only. They'd gone. Sure you want to keep those in the house? I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason. I thought it was funny. They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start. Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing... The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his. Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert? What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...! Want to join me in some cartwheels? No. I feel more like - yodeling. Yodeling? What is it? A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location. Really? What kind of exhibition is it? I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus... You're kidding. Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you. You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together. God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me... They tried... but I didn't let them. Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party. Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing? The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective. Ready quantum torpedo. They'll pull us right down I tell ya! Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on! What did he have? He had fish. Please.  It won't happen again. No, thank you.  I'll walk. What do you want? Your advice! They didn't offer you the job yet. I want your feelings about it. Right now? Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know. Look, baby, can we talk about it later? Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance. Fine. Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred? Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up. The airport. It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about. So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school. Uh-huh. Any idea where I might start looking? She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then. All you want is a phone number? Well, I know you're busy... Don't play games with me, Ted. I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador. I don't buy it. You don't buy what? And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you? Otherwise, you're not ugly. Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast. What's with the dark? What do you think you're doing? Why, I'm assisting you, sir. Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there! Yes, sir. Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants! Miss Price. Yes, Mrs. Hobbs. Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that? Has he been refusing food? Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold. Yes, Mrs. Hobbs. ... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses. Sounds like Beverly Hills. Here, are you always this sarky? Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go. Weren't you on a television series? If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie? Said it went on for donkey's years. Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue. Oh, it just ended, then. Now who's being sarcastic? When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean. I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars. You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions. I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material. I would not presume to debate you. That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one. Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life. Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns. Yeah? Hey, Mickey. I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports. Next time I'll use valet parking. Did he say anything about my sister? Just what he told your detective. I don't know. Owwww. Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww. David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary. What is it? You wouldn't believe me. I would. I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you. Why don't you come to our house instead? I can't do that -- When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room? I can't leave when I'm so close. There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here -- That's absurd -- You're dying here.  Don't you see that?! Each of those grids represents almost a square mile. That's a big area to cover. Andy! Serafine? Is that you? What's going on? Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night... God, well don't let him go! Catch him! Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either. I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it. I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . . We're going to get help. We gotta try. Anybody else? ...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair. It did? Isn't it like, obvious? Not to me. Either you want to or you don't. I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police. If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers... Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared. Me too. That's why I fight so hard. Where are we going? We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college. No, I'm lost. You're lost? Say,...did you just lose your job because of me? Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead. Dickhead? A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead. Are you ok? When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you... No... ... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said. Merry Christmas. A merry Christmas to you, Amy. You had to remind me? Are you writing a poem? No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela? Your old man thinks I did it, don't he? He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change? The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure. Nobody's gonna kill you. I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton. A broker? Really. And now you re in the tire business? That s right. And auto supply... Uh huh. The retail end, I understand. Yes. Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call. Thank you, Will. I'll do that. It'd make their heads explode. Millionaires, man. Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat... I love him. <i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i> <i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i> Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations. And he didn't have them? He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks. Is that all? No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit... And you believed him? I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that? 39   CONTINUED: Back against the bars.  Now. That's even a greater honor. I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people. I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars. Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance. Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally? $50? I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose. Your Excellency, haven't we met before? Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder. You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting. Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand -- You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up? Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire. I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth. Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy. You're better than candy. I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough. Is there something else I can do for you? Well, I'd love to see inside your club. You want to come inside? Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything. Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president. Oh, you'll still, be guarding him. Do you see them yet? Patience my love, patience. That's a virtue isn't it? Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank? Come on back up here! Nope. Give me back my hat! Double nope! ...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss. Yes Sheriff. I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might. You want me to wait til you've quit the building? Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary. And you? I didn't dive. You'll try again tomorrow? I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired. You're a good sport, lady. I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great. Yeah, I really cleaned up on him. Where's your wife, Jake? Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around? Where's Bert? He went off someplace. Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it. Why? Just for luck. What the fuck?! They shouldn't have come without calling first. Santos... What's happenin' here? Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here. Where we goin'? Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile. Please Santos... Where's Johnnie? Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years. That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty. Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles? Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off. He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings. So then you just call him. I call. Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles. That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead. And your principles? I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles. If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me. Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise. I will go. But not you. You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did. I don't want you to be hurt. Come on. Where do you think you're going? It's my day off. But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian? I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things? Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town. Would you like me better if I were a nun? No. Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman? Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing... With a Ramses graph on the binary tree-- --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side-- Maker can. This is not new, Gerry! Are you sure you can afford twenty-five? Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon? Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules! Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage -- Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand? Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility. Yours...?! As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help... No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding. Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship. Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis! Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!! What is wrong? Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right? That's the price, my brother. Yo, I don't have that kind of cash. For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash. How long you gonna be here? Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party. You're gonna be at John K's party? My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh. Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right? The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning. Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there? I'll see you there. Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4... I had the worst goddamn nightmare. You have nine points left on your license.. Thanks for reminding me.. And her lips? Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy! And her voice? Like lark song? Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song. She sings too? Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom? What of her bosom? Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples! I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player? Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden! But what of Lord Wessex? For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes! We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it. No. No? No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra. He's drowning me! It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys. I'm a ghost.  Boo. I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first... Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil! This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you. Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces! They would? Um-hmm. Where's Kansas? That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me. You're going to see a Wizard? Um-hmm. Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains? I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now. Yes -- that's true. But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble. Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match. I don't blame you for that. But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you? I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and... I don't want to learn. You don't want to learn. No. And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay. No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it. Well, I doubt I want it very much myself. It was more to your wife that I gave it. Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it. Nice place. Thank you. Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns. What? You heard me.  You two, especially. The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils. No! <u>Niente!</u> That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes. CONTINUED Did they have any explanation for this? Egon! Hello, Venkman. How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh? I think they're more interested in my epididymis. I don't even want to know where that is. Alright, I will. I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins. What do you think, Adam? That's a fact, isn't it? Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination. She's gettin' away! Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it! The Penny Saver sucks. Yeah, but it sucks for free. So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six. We got five. Putting Ashley outside. You need six. You knew her? What? The girl. How's it feel? About as good as it looks. Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton. A woman eh? I see. I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something This is your dream girl, is it? What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes. You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet. We...we could go home with something else. What? With...with millions.  Millions of dollars. Ask me them again. One by one. What do you do? I don't remember. Where are you from. Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet. What's your favorite color? I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black. What's your favorite movie star? Burt Reynolds. Would you like a bite of my pie? Yes, I would. Yes. Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run! Did you say...? Uh, uh... Where are you? I'm here. No... No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted. Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry. Sorry for what? I should have done this a long long time ago. A venison pie as big as a house. A small house. And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination. Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes. Well, one of the men didn't like him so much... A soft side? Who knew? Yeah, well, don't let it get out So what's your excuse? Acting the way we do. Yes I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change. So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered? Something like that Then you screwed up How? You never disappointed me. It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there. Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV! Will it hurt? That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink? Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened? For once, Stu, drop it. Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you. I've got a better idea... OK...where do you want to start? Remember him? He was a bit proud as I recall. He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning. He turned out all right. This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop. I say we keep sittin' on Boca. What do you think? Great. Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it? I know. I would bury it in the garden. Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden. Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil ! Voil  what? Up there! I would put it up there! It means "bloodbrother. I don't understand. One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents... Okay, I follow you so far... Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars. You're joking. To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash. Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be? Six one. He's too tall. Why do you wish to sail west? To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it... Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot. Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain? I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point -- Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ... By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ... And where's that? Um ... Outside of Pleasantville. Break's over. This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing? Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge. Yeah? What do you want? Buddy, are we in trouble. Hey, what is this? You got black soap? It's for my complexion. Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em? Oh, don't go, okay? Please. Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter? Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch. Wow!  Does this pole still work? This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company. Boy, am I glad to see you. What are you doing here? We have to talk. Your painful groin? I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck. Oh! You're supposed to fasten it! All in good time. If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle. Me too.  Bye now. Let me carry one of the instruments. Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart? We have to do something, oh God... Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay... Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot. You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory. Huh? Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book. What is it? Listen. I hear nothing. No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs. Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em. You don't love ME. No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people... What -- rape? No. It isn't rape then, is it? Oh, get it over with. I don't suppose... no... What? I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all? What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me... Sounds like you, Hicks. The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly -- Do you really think Billy did it? He was there, Tatum. I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw. I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy  Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom? Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat? Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today. Here's a real present. What... huh? Check it out. Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God! Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just... Oh! My God! What's your other question? My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime? Where's the candy? There is no candy! What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?! Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me. Thanks.  Take care - You too. This the load you lost a while back? It is.  He try to take tonight's load? Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made! Now you're a professional! Mick. Mick. Mick... What? You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when... I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...? Hey, Gallagher! Yeah? How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach? It'll be ready in a minute. Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job. Sorry, boss  Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all. I had to, Edie. I had to see you. Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you. You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you? I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go. Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you. How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other. I don't want to hurt Charley  I don't want to hurt you... It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out. I know what you want me to do! I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do. That    word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... . I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table. I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... . Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane -- Come in, boy -- come in. Only four more cars. And if we don t find him - we ll search the whole train again. What s Hunt doing on the TGV? High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max. But why tell us? He s putting on a show, Barnes. What kind of show. I don t know.  It didn t say on the tickets. Nice meeting you. You as well. There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper. Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez! I think I'm dying . . . Don't . . . please! Please, don't! Where you going? I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad? No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful! I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close. Probably not. So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what? I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there. In where? [Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket. That's OK. Look. We want you on the job. I want you to turn this into a silver bullet. You're not going to let it go, are you? I saw what I saw. Marty, the moon wasn't even full! Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left? My right. Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it? You don't know him - You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address. You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense. Yeah. Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"? Sure, all the time, in Group. In Group? Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA. Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense. Intense. How long were you in there? Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated. Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink? No. Oh, maybe. Fuck. I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab. Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first. It was pretty bad, huh? It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me. The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights. Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them! Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man? Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day-- Yes? I'm comin' for my twenty thousand. Luciano is dead? Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it. If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying. Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out. You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me. You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up. You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too. Why the fuck would I do that? Thank you. When Debby... Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you? Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course... Now what? Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies... Free? Yes.  They're free. Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore. It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible? It's just not. Why not, you stupid bastard? Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright? Dad... It's the treatment. More retching. Will you take me back to my grandparents? Of course. Sure. I met you. Oh. What's happening about the opera? Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if  Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room? Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room. No way. Yes. No. Yes. Not me...no way... We were in a car accident -- They were in a car accident. But everybody is all right. They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit. Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ... And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three. The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head. Captain, what's happening?! We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for -- David -- Mother, go back! Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes. Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral? I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs. Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good? Too warm for a sweater, anyway. You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica? Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here. Just a minute. I think it would be much better if you went away. We shall see who remains here the longer. As you will. You can start Monday week. Fine. That hair will have to go. Fine. Where'd he go?? I don't <u>know</u>. You can! I can? Okay.  Okay... ) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies... Can you tell us what's on the disc? ) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it. I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily! They outnumber us, my Lord -- <U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks! If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite. No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys. You've talked to Billy? I did. And Billy told you that he'll tell that to... Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect. Why... why are you like this? You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand. Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame. Gloria Golden? Yeah, little Gloria. The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh? Right - for the first time this year. Well - it's only April. Come on, get going, get going! Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office. Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it. All right. Give me a voucher for expenses. What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is. I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over. I'd say this is slightly different. Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated. I thought you were here because you want to go. I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home. You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham? I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way. I thought you and George were getting married. We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me! I wish I only had your problems. Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay? Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over. I was like yes! I'm going out with him! That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex. Yep. Because he can like climax you up to that... As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter. Thanks for having me, Sally. Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers? Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak. It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes. No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings. You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices? There weren't any voices. Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts? As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism. What do you mean by that? Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed. Are you saying he's legally sane? Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority. Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God. Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay. And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass? Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil. Civil?  I'm civil. You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me. Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright? Cereal. Yeah? Go fix the phones. Roger. Somebody already did. What? You didn't hear? Hear what? Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out. Did the police contact you? Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure. The stewardess. Do you know her last name? Brown, Jackie Brown. What does she do for you? Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out. Beaumont worked for you. That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money! Was she? Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears? You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out. If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything? Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand. Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand? You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement -- Jackie ain't got time for all that shit -- I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks. I got it. I just don't got it on me. Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess. Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit. If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit. Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind. Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab. Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused -- Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her? Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with. Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business? No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand. ... I'm listening. Mr. Gordon  Huh? Did you know he reversed the charges on that call? What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. Never? You're a fool! Yes, I am rather. Be careful. Of course, I'll be careful. Well, some kids can't handle it like you can. Did one of those things grow inside her? Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength. Shall I draw your bath, sir? Lieutenant? What?  Who are you?  What do you want? My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you. Talk to me about what? Hey   Willie Mays. Willie Mays. What's in here then, lead? It's my mother's piano. A piano? ... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true. ... just remember that,  cause I'll be back ... When'd you get to town, Raines? The other day.... What for? No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ... Where you been, anyway? Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ... You seem a little hinked-up ... Not at all ... What did you do to the batteries? Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he? That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here? Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running. Which mean physically going outside. Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape? Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A. Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig. I can come visit? You better! Yes! I will. It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs. Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?! I'm directing. Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room. I'll go. I don't mind. Really. Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running. Yeah, yeah. Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will. Lindsey!  Wait a second-- It's a tradition. I know, Dad. I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair... You went berserk... I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald... So did your father... So did my father and his father before him. But it's a responsibility... But it's a responsibility being a Berserk. I must only let the red rage... You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle. I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES! Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God. ...and put them in your mouth. So tell me ... am I still an angel? With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away. Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off. Poor bastard. You, Zack? Yes, Sir. I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage. Do you have it? Yeah. It's right here. This is a Rolex, I can't take it. Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane. Ooooh, busted. Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight. How long were you hooked? What? You don't have to talk about it. Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator? We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner. Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela? Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this. Joey -- do it. I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken? And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers. Jack. Your doorbell doesn't work. Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack. ...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it? Ummmmmmmmmmmmm. Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon. Sid, I'll seeya tonight. But... Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom! Damn. Mom? Baby names? I don't know. Nightmare. You want me to scooch over next to you? Yes. Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her? Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen... She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future. We're not certain... You said Nazi Low-riders...? We're not certain! Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me! How did you get in here? I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep. You were just looking around... That's all. What for? You probably won't believe me. Probably not. It was for my report. What report? To whom? About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools? I've heard of them. Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president. Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it? Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars. Where is she? Good to see you too, Elaine. Why isn't she with you? Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private. Tubbs, it's me. Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk? No...I'm in some trouble... Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law? Yeah... If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check? Check. How can I go on? I feel so... responsible. Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen. You think I shouldn't fly. I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man. Would you take me back? Would they? I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men. What d'you got? I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count. You're kidding, right? I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way -- Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won. Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser. What is the Dead Poets Society? With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month! Good luck. Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby? Not exactly. They were vampires, weren't they? Yeah. God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires. Kiss, kiss? Uh, OK. Sure. You don't believe in anything, do you? Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket. And if you don't? If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here. But that's living like an animal  Keep her together until I get back. I always do. Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation? No. Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship? No. Can I move now? No. I must deactivate you. For how long? Indefinitely. How long is that? Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby... I love you... I found one. Alive? Frozen. So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now? Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit. Be careful. Here? You gotta be kiddin'. I thought you say Tuesday. Better late than never. What's this? You got a leak in the number nine compartment. No, no. You got leak. You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new. That cost me twenty grand at least. Fifteen, at the most. Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it. Forgive me. It's childish to cry. Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves. Only one car. Let's do it. Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello. Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee? Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please! You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances? Environment.  That's cool with me. Okay. Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan. Take us right to Kennedy. Now. You all right? Sure. Shelly? Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise..... I've gotta go in. Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you. Get rid of them. Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go... Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived. We're being hailed. Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress. I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet. Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor? I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child. Ah, that is good. And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness. Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness. I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all. If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas? Fly. That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you. Sit down, Frank. No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving. Ryan's really angry with me. I think he's really angry with me too. It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank. I'm sorry. Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment. That's a lot of those. Medallions. A lot of cakes. Yes. And he doesn't smoke? He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better. How long have you been married? Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about. You must have been a baby. Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold. Come here. Where's Mom? I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe. You shouldn't have said that. Why? Your father doesn't like Mexicans. When do we take the tests? Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening. You're marrying again. Yes. Jamie wanted that. She told me. ...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer... Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to... ...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done? Talia, you're a wonderful person... Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every-- I just never thought of you in that... I gotta...I gotta go do a "bunk check." Or some fucking thing. You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy? The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out. Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer. May I see your license? Why? Please. And three weeks. It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine. It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me. You take care of yourself...  Graham. I wish I could go. We all do. Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to-- Beast. Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars. Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss. Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please? It's my mother.  Who needs this shit? What is it now? Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died. I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have? Sea bass. Right. They're mutated sea bass. Really? Are they ill-tempered? Please allow me to demonstrate. I just wait. You know? Huh? I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year. So do I. You do? Yeah. We'll fix that, too. Just -- one -- second! How much less? Never would be plenty. I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him. what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome. Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after. Not at all, Governor.  Very striking. Who's that? The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo. What's a King Pin? John's bad. Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off! That's all we've got left. It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight. Yeah, but whose point of view? Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view. Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin? You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like... Magic. Magic. After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood! Hell, Starla. I always regretted that. This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score. Heh heh. Thank God. I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!? Thank you. I can't believe they decided you won. They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite. Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble. Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today. Don't you fucking knock? Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa. Paul, get out! So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me -- Oh Jesus Jesus... He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him. For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart? All right, motherfucker, that's it. They don't want to come down. Why not? Where is he? He's inside you, where he hides. I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him. In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him. I don't want to leave the convent, Mother. I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again. ...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it.... Are you shitting me?? Right in the store? She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front.... It's chow, Animal! Chow! Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there! No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on! I don't care if they wear galoshes! You want Betty Grable! Let me go! Betty Grable! And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is. That's really romantic. Okay. These are for you.  From father to son. As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission -- Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny... It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure? It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine. Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me. I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name? I'll go. Wrong. What, vou? I'm not the chemical weapons expert. Permission to come aboard, Captain? Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you. Yes, we've been through death and life together. I'll tell you later. It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream. It's okay, babe.  We're with you. I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed. We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere. I thought you were against fighting. I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters. Let's go. No...I, er. No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday? No. Saturday? I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF! Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me. Well, he missed! I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even. This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open! -- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear -- Lester, don't you think that uhh -- With your hands or your tongue? You're not well. They shouldn't have been here. We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on! This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters. Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged. They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying. -- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war! We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1. General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve. So how's school treating you? All right. Classes? Good. Grades? Fine. Anyone special? You know... Hnnn. Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh? Yeah. You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well -- Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away. Don't do it, Sam! Shut up! He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker. They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ... How is he? He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us... How much is it? Two hundred and seventy. That's my father. I got to run. Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again? Twenty-after-ten. Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already. Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot. Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry. Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him. By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here. Just like a ghost ship, huh? Yes. She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady? How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...? The dynamite... Dynamite? Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means? What does that mean? It means it was homemade. This is... really a shock... Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator. Who do you think could've done this? I'll ask the questions, son. Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me. I don't think so... Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here! Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them. John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him. He ain't my Dad. Is that so? What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's? What's the action around? Slow. Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut. Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few. 10-4 good buddy. He's from New York City. That one, too. New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here. I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right. Ten A.M. Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry. All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear. Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that? Why is he acting so strangely? I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed. Who is it? Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right. Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!! Clench your teeth. Wh... what... ?! Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue. ... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like. They was a boy. We made friends. I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world. It's too big. Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy? Don't say nothin' about that boy. Leave us alone you sick fuck! Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself. Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan? No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back... They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word... Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you? Fallout shelter. Get outta there! I can't!  Do you mind! I'll cover you!  Get outta there!! We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family. All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me. I know where you are. Very good.  How did you know? The pipes. What about our friend - Sark? Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here. Not us, I hope. Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs. And where do you think you're going? Out. You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick. No, I won't. Who was it? Kirsty. In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it? It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money. Did you see Daddy? No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time. Can I go when the holiday comes? You sure can, son... Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments. She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her. Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO. Still, you could never ... do what she wanted. Gabriel?  Are you asleep? We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some. How long will it take you to prepare this? A couple of hours. Well, get to it. Want to work? Sure, but what is this? That's not your affair. Name. Joad. How many men? Four. Women? Two. Kids? Two. Can all of you work? Why, I guess so. Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away. Sure is. God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic? I have to go now. One last question. How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III? That's right. I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim? You could say that. Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that. That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right? Yeah, guess so. How'd you know? TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie. Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing? Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled. Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov. Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me. Why? He doesn't like me. What you eatin'? Lednov. I didn't use you, Max. I didn't say you did. I never lied to you. I know. We're partners. I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do. Do you blame yourself for helping me? You're the Indian FBI. That's right. Turn around. Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go. Video store? I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it. If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man. Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either. Smashing! What the fuck? Brimmer! Could you come in here please? When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you. I know. I'm always here, Pete. Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch? Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you. For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin... It was planted on me, sir. We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe? Charming Carlton. It is so hot in here. We weren't sure where it was taking place, like. Nice of you to come. No. Frank was a good bloke. What do you think? Well.... er... Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on? Oh, we didn't get it all the way on. Whose fault was that? I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault. What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie. If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief. Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake. What guy? Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road. Sick?  How sick? The flu. So she's got a few sniffles. Doctor's orders. Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand? Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion. Good idea. Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here. Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent. Impotent?  I'm not impotent. You seem... disturbed. I... No. You do this for money? Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play? Up north. Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release? Playing. Playing? We... Three bullets. And then you... Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something? Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated. You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check? NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first. Then what? Checkmate. What's the temperature now? Fifty degrees below and still falling. When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it. Honey, what is it? Hydrophobia... Michael, take deep breaths. I have to get out of here. Come on. I can't take water, Kathryn. Yes, you can. I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it! You want me to say that. I want you.  To tell the truth. Good party. The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest. Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while? Who's my cream puff? I am. You set?  Sarge nods. Yes, sir. No deal. Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job... Is that right? Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole. Nice talk, Sugarmouth. You've been in this house for a while? I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora. I never met her. There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither. You'll always play with me? Whenever you want. Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick. They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast? Dorota! I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself. How are you doing? Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful. Don't worry, it won't last long. That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd! I'll see you...soon. We'll stay overnight, get a hotel-- --Cotter's-- Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense? Yes... It makes sense. Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her. Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me. I took her there for a shower and that's it. Just a shower? Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>... Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac... Oh huzzah, the master's home. Do you have it?! Hello, Mr. Philby. Ten is standard, sir. Fine. But only if we recover the cash. Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear. No they couldn't, somebody had to see something. My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid. Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why? You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours. What scars? The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen. Get out of here! You can't bribe me! Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea! What? He says it's a bad idea! What's a bad idea? If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes. It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson! My name's Grant. Grant Ashby. Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn. <u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>! As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again. Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation. It seems human.  To me. No, you didn't, Frank. Okay, that's no problem. That's exactly what you said last week. No prob. I'm cool. Thanks, Scoob. Who threw this party, anyway? Damned if I know... I have the whole weekend off. Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and -- One night with me! You think you're kidding. I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going? Absolutely. The map is very clear. Let me take a look at that map. Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help. Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway? Are you getting this on tape? I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it. We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn. What clothes? You been made, MacReady. I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich. Neuvich, the clown of the crusades. But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do? Offered the Pope one of his whores. Would you like me to stay? Mm hmm. I could stay and go. . . . And just how would you manage that? Is it over? No, it's getting worse. That's an old one.  One of our first. This is the official composite of the three precogs? That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions. Show me just Agatha's data stream. For that, we have to go for a ride. Well, I don't understand. I'm sorry. When you were gone last year -- where were you? Busy Were you in jail? Maybe. No, you weren't Then why'd you ask? Why'd you lie? You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back? Stop it -- Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it? Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . . It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections-- Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist. Of course. As soon as possible. No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ... No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ... That's terrible! You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed? I want them spitting blood! Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy! You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you. And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be! But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?! Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years! I won't go, Daddy! I won't go! Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me! CQ what? Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home. Look, snap out of it, will ya? Kiss me. What the hell is happening, Worf? It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room. Where are you meeting this person? At the Zoo. The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they? I've never been to it. Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you. I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie. The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot. Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one. No thanks. I'm fine without them. Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle. Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you? Nothing. They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true? It's true. Put it here. Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble. Better keep a lookout. So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides. That's what I do. Seen a lot of islands? Quite a few. Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one... Anti social? Self sufficient... With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right? Takes one to know one. A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous. Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy.. That's missile lock! He better be kidding! Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps! I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing? Winning. What do you want from me? At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog.. My dog! Promise you'll turn around if you get tired. I will.  Bye. Gus, this -- Good coffee, isn't it? Where are you going? Home! Home? I'm fired. Who fired you? You did. Nice. I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. Ain't we good-timing here ... ? The family that steals together, deals together... Dad'd be proud -- Maybe not. But Dad was from another era... What era was that -- ? The era when crime didn't pay -- As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher? Price of doing business... What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ? It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic? You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that. You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson. I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you. I think you better sit down. Oh God, I hate things that start like that.... Gail, please. Let's move it we got company! What happened! You don't trust me. I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television. In radio we're different. I bet.  Thanks for the drink. I know you smoke weed, right? Why you say that? Cause your lips is getting black. He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone... Any chance of one of them confessing someday? ...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it. ...and your General? ...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket... Ever ask him? You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more. His name? Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough... Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over. Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over. Say again?  How many micks? 15, sir. Hi. You're Shelly? I'm sorry. Well, hello. I'm Isaac... I'm three. I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home? We've got nothing to talk about LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think She's in the green. Lock fuel rods. Locked. Nuclear turbine to 75% power. Where's Bert? He went off someplace. Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it. Why? Just for luck. Hey.  Eyes on your own belly! Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game? Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York. Saddle River's in New Jersey. Saddle River, New York! It's in New Jersey. New York. I think it's in New Jersey. It's in New York. Oh, I didn't know that. ... I was dreaming ... Something good? We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you. Must've been after we got engaged. Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother. So you had a nightmare. Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open. Were you there to catch me? No. How come? I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help. Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while. Tough day? Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking? Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks. Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort? Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right. How nice. All right, we'll take Jeff with us-- I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons. Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  * Why would I have a gun? Hi, Penelope. Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever! Shall I answer it? No! No, it's him! Who? The man. He's here. What man? Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you. How ya doin' Miss Evans? You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now. No way. Lloyd. What? What's wrong? I'm nervous--my old man's here. Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country. What? You are crazy! Look, just hear me out, okay? There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer? Animal! Got a little something for you! Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls... He should be put in jail. Half a buck I'd put him in jail... You should. I had a witness I would. A witness to what...? You know, the rape, to...even to the accident... You mean <u>with White</u>...? What? You mean you need a witness in addition to White...? Who's White...? The writer. He saw the accident...? Sure. He saw the girl in the car... You bet he did. No, but there are four guys back there you might check out. Thanks, buddy. You're killin' me here. Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours. Oh, baby, you cruel... Hey! Hey! You really suck, you know that? Just go. Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed. I made spaghetti. Do you want some? I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow. A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked. Do you know how often these pourers get hit on? Humped Yes. I can think of worse ways to go-- But I understand what you mean. You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon. I blew it, Dr. Lester. You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. But now we've lost access to Craig. My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to. Don't ask me in. Please, Jimmy. No. Can't pretend that much. I miss you, Jimmy. Should have stayed a girl. Don't be cruel. Okay. Be a good girl and go inside. Only if you kiss me. She says she has a secret to tell. What? Okay.  Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. What? Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I? I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie. He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it. Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss. I thought you said you could handle him. I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal. What's wrong with him? What do you think? Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved. He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do. I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got -- Don't even say it, man. She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live. I know you will. Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy. Would you like something to drink? What are you having? Iced tea. Yeah. Fine, thank you. I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you. You humiliated me! No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party. I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me. Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again. Thank you. It was a lovely dinner. Good. But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone. I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him. He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk. -- I want to be Elvis. It's my idea. C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do. Okay.   You can be Elvis. Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him. We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war. Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast. You were unfair with them. Says who? Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched. Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches. They feel cheated. Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family. Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone! And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami. Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean. The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami. I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them. How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of. No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed. You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood. Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him. He did business...but he never trusted him. Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities? You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park. Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard. I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum -- Just do it, old man. It's French, though.  It really is. Yeah. It feels like you're in France. Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one. Have you read the story on Elvis? No. Not yet. You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong. That good, huh? I'm scared. Me too. What's he doing? The best he can since you gave him nothing. Which way? Across both tracks!! Please, don't you realize? She is dying. Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take. Oh yes, there is. I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles? No. Sure you don't want any salad? No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks? I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but... She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather... I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax. All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential. Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off. Thank you, Mr. Lawson. Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are. This is very good for us. It is? The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow. As long as he keeps out of the park. After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again. The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down. We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates? That's the XKE. The what? It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition. What kind of a life is that? He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park! If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty. No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more. I wish Paul luck. It's suicide! I'd be dead by now if that were the case. Meaning? Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight. Why would you do that? To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace-- I'm amazed. Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me. And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there! They didn't murder me. Paul's only twelve years old. He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound. We've got to rescue him. If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that. He's not your son. No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build. It's a jungle out there. That's been said before. He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged. Oh, somebody else sitting there? No, no, no that's your seat. But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw! No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy. Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS. It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel. I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK. What are you doing up so early? I couldn't sleep last night. I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not. Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune. Yes, well, they are. Then I'm afraid I don't understand. They are in tune.  But not with each other. Is that important? Uh, well ... You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth. Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster. I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want? My life is a living hell. I hardly recognize you with a beard. That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me. I feel in love with George again. Scarecrows? Let's take a look. Right... Okay, great!  So let's reset! How long does he have? I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating. It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her. Why do you think she did it? Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows. Maybe they put a horse head in her bed? Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke. What's it to you? I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business. Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys? Here it is. What is it? It's a sun dress. It looks like a tablecloth. It does not. Checked and locked, sir. Louder, girl! Checked and locked, sir. Kitchen and lower house. Are you nodding? Yeah. I can't hear when you're nodding. Sorry. We'll be there in ten minutes. Help me! Help me! Here. I'll do it. Well Rose was being very thorough. Was Rose. Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town. That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck? Paracelsus? Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa... What is your name? Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva. Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism? It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen. I can't even stand up -- I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes. The nano... what? Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch. I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy. There can't be very much- Oh, but there is- - and easy or not, I won't believe a word. Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down. We just smeared a skunk. Shit! So -- what do we do now? Find the jacket. Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that? First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car. It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas. Where are you? About two hundred yards from the bridge. They re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications. How much did you part with? Seven hundred for the pair. No longer. Frost!!! Absolutely.  Good idea. With those camera lights and... He's going with you, Doctor. No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out. And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it! No. I hear she's a very pretty girl. Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment. Aye.  You have a point there. Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back. Oh, yes, that's right. ...Shit! What is it? Did you see his face? No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter. I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight? I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late. Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later. I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke. Will, sit down... Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them? You gotta ask <u>that</u>? Would you like more tea? No thank you, I'm fine. And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up... Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new. They're new to us... Be my friend. Good.  From me you'll get Justice. Godfather. Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return. Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting -- You called 911. Except the call was intercepted. They took her -- I was right! Step on it! Let go! We've got to stop! Now you're the one that's out of your mind. Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us! Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD. What have you done, LSD? Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby. I mean in show business. Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut. What do you do best? Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for. Oh, sing.  Sing! Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up? Sing a song!  Just sing a song! Ohhh. What? Look. Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown... The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends. My quarters. Why is everything...like this? It's a flat. But wait a micro... I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me. That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings. You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you? Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there. Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me. Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer! You down? Yeah, we're down. What do you see? Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!! No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself! What's down there? Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion. I'd like to have a look. Give me your coat. Let it ride for a while. You're going to stay, aren't you? That was the general idea. Come on. Bad time? Kind of. Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in. I think you better tell us. We don't even know you. Well, we're FBI agents. You're not FBI agents. Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds? Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp. But you eat, don't you? Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee. Where do you keep the can opener? In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard. What kind of deal you looking to? What's the Blue Book price? That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition. Been here long? Just since yesterday. I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single. You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg? Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A... So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump? Just two. So far.							  * The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir. Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do. What do you think happened on this boat? I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it? The what? Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time. Are we smart enough to avoid that? I don't know, are we? They're preparing to fire. Shields up, Captain --? I feel like you're turning me into a VCR. I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes. Get to the ship! Come back here... Where are you going? I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it. Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos. I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me. A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it. He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him! How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you? Yes.  Fine. That's it?  Yes.  Fine? I don't want to talk about it. Why not? I never like to talk about my work. Alright.  Well, that's something new. No.  Not something new. Well, something's wrong. Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah. Um.  Happy for you. Thanks. So tell me, how's it going? Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster? You're my best friend. That's not an answer, is it? Yes, you're a monster. -- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end? I don't understand. No. No? Not even one more? I never do more than one. I'm sorry. I can't talk you into it? No. You'll have to get somebody else. Now who the hell is going to do that for me? I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer. But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything. Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice. So make an exception. No. How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know? I would. Well, what the hell am I supposed to do? Cynthia, I don't know. I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me. I'm sorry. I can't do it. Goddamit, give me my tape, then. No. We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation. We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours. I shall look forward to it. She likes you. Definitely. Ask her out. So, school going alright? Okay, I guess. Making friends? Hey.  You okay, Flea? Snot me.  It's him. We're within range, sir. Beam them directly to Sickbay. I do not often think of the past. Who is it he reminds you of? There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary. What do you mean? The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief. I'm holding your hand! No, you're not. ...Nancy? James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore? What? I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...? Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them? So who left who? She left me. Why? She saw through me. Uh-oh.  That's not good. Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose. No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason. Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk. He told me he was turning in early... Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life? No.  I need a drink. Now where are you going? To the bathroom, where do you think? Have I done the right thing? You don't trust me. I have no reason to. Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would. And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions. All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you. Can you read? Sure ... What's wrong with Applejack? He's having a heart attack or something. Let's go! ... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house. But the place burned to the ground. The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where. Are you at peace with your family? Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here. Goals are important. I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life... We are all impressed. I don't like sugar There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea? It's not that - I just don't want any sugar Why whats wrong with the sugar - Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis. I know. I could have picked you up. Huh? Late one night. About three. At the plaza. Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else. No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks. My mother is not dead! I didn't think so. ...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em. You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much... Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date. You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to... Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again. Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action. Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested. I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator. The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ... Max.  This is Anna. Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine. They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs. Fletcher, I want you back here. Personally, I'd prefer stupidity. Pride will do. --you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions-- --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions-- --quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances-- Hey, there she is... Whatever play I maker just back me up. If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in. Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps... Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started. Partnership? Well, you got to admit we come a long way. Oh, boy! Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod! Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later. Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers. Where is my family? Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you. And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube. I've been looking for you. Why me? What do you want from me!? So, why did you take me up there? I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat? It's not like her. Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter. Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man? Good.  Let's get dry. I can't -- I won't be able to stop -- Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is. I'll see to Pearl. I'll make coffee. Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him? I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me. Okay, we're square now, right? There's just one more thing I need you to do. That's all right.  Well, we'll be going. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry. Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help. No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it? Yes. Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call. Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over. Was she one of your teachers? No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me. Do you know who that is? Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves. Got it. Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there... Frank.  Where s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet? Mr. Mintz?  I don t think so...building s closed pal.  You ll have to come back tomorrow. Look, I don t know what s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company. I don t care who you are.  It s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed. Maybe you re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President... But he's got five times the man-power to draw on. We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones. Sweetheart... Don't call me that! Don't call me anything! You... you remember Eagle Hendershot? Huh? Uh... yeah. I seen him. He's dead, Bill. His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside. Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you? Worms was comin' out. Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies. Cannon or Gatling? Both would be nice. Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up. It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way. Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead. Why was the maid crying? I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is? A figure of St. Sebastian. Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial. Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live... Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"? Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live. Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number-- I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward. You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth-- Who paid the bill? It's a company... MPG Capital. Well, I'm sorry. So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away. Or if there's a full moon. Or if your boyfriend's an asshole. After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women. Yeah... Say, what happened to your hand? Accident. You've got to be-- Yeah, I know.  More careful. I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna. That's a solid name. I'm a solid man. Bobby Cooper. Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop? An overheated car. Oh? Darrell taking good care of you? Darrell's a moron. Are you related to Li Mu Bai? He is my defeated foe! How did I get here, how did you bring me back? Nanotechnology. Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible. We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years. 30? How long was I out? Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman! No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib? No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover. That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes. It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band. Hold on a minute. Sleep all right? Yes, thanks. Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should. What? Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it? And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well. You know that can't happen. Oh, why is that? Why is that, Louis? Bel Air is restricted. What now? And don't give me some movie clich  like 'trust me. Trust me. Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill? I heard them Morgan. Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment. How'd you know? They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die. Cole, what the hell are you doing? She's mine! I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week. Liar! Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work. Look, do you want the bed in or not? Just take it slowly. Oh, sod you. We're closed, sir. Where's that guy going? He left his sweater. Well, I left some money in there. Where? In the cash register. Step away from the door. We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us. That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry! We can take your car. It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great. Fact of the matter - there never was! But... but... What is it now? Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died. I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have? Sea bass. Right. They're mutated sea bass. Really? Are they ill-tempered? Please allow me to demonstrate. It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting. Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry. Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing. I'm not here to - I can't... Couldn't have said it better myself. You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent? Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer. Murderer?  Really? What did you say to her? I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden-- What's she saying? Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies? You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism! What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help! Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right? ...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet. Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth! Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw. Hugh, I'm impressed.. It was a wonderful day. You still haven't answered my question. You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over. The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents-- You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it. A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think. They are beautiful. Yes, they are. You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one. But... It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have. I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby. You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now. Get off my roof! Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here! Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming. Does he have a metal plate in his head? You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long. May I help you? I -- what are you?! I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you? What's happening to the moon?! How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten? Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he? In jail. That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good. Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...   organize an expedition - All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London. I thought I'd give it to you. Thank you.  Shall I... No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed. Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway. I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ... What's the thing? You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you. No. Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go. You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown. Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne? It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him. You're sure... I've never been more sure of anything in my life. Oww! Careful.  What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing, huh? That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff? Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'? Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal. Oh.  Want to talk about it? No. Terrific. Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much. Just some flies. Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some. Oh. I see. For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she? Across at Brinkmeyer's. Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight. Yeah? How's it look? It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it. I told you it wasn't no jive. Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it. Stone mutha. Exactly. Stoned mother. Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box. There's a chocolate cream filled in there? Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special. Tough titty, it's mine now. Look, I'll trade you. Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay. That's all right. Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me... That's too bad. I thought you said you never knew your father. I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death? I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it. I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places. I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire. You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality. Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened? I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper. Ben!  What's wrong? I killed her! Hi. You're Shelly? I'm sorry. You see that? Yeah. Good.  Thought I was imagining them. Four thousand. Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500. But you want days too. All right, two thousand. Three. Done. Holy shit. Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true? Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant! You bet. and totally irrelevant. Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted. I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters. Oh. How about before that? Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry. He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle. That's unique. Yeah.  And he still went to the party. She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it. Just see how happy the people look... from here.... That's it?  "I'll be back? It's a rough translation from the Moldavian. But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place? According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine. Ready? What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden? What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein? General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory -- Then you know him? Do I know him -- I know him through and through. She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did. Then I guess we're even. What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove? The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily. How long is temporarily? I trust not until July. Hello? Hello, mom? Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright? I found dad. He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born. Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late. You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you? I gotta go. Love ya mom. Which one is yours - the big one? Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve. I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife? No, my flag steward. And who mixes the cocktails - your wife? No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not - I'm not interested at all. Well, I'm not. That's very interesting. ...When did you know all this? Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we -- Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me. Good good. Well I think you're right, I should look her up. Rollerpig? Are you nuts? But you said she was a sparkplug...? I said buttplug. She's heinous. Hello? Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight. You know her? Not really. Why her? Because she's the type. But you said you didn't know her. I know what I said!  She looks just like... Just like who? I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting. I'm just trying to play the game. You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them. Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden. Howdy. Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks. David. Do you have cause to bothering us? Shhhh! Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad. Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>! Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>! Why don't you back off? You want some too? Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you I love you too. It will heal. I'm sorry. There's no need to be. Where are Thomas and Fedens? I sent them home. Go and call them. I tried already. The phones do not work. Aw shit. Nice tattoo, Dietz. He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us. No! I'll get the dress. He's here!... He's here! Do you have your ticket? Yes. Passport? Look, I just better go. Me too? We'll see. Oh what have I done? He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out. Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr... Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog... There are over 4 million people in this city - why me? I thought you d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me... Leave my sister alone. And why would I do that? What's this? Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported. While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch. Look. Do that again. What. Smile. Son-of-a-bitch. We're short one long boat too.  Come on. You know where it is? Um, yeah, thirty miles east. You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies. What an honor... Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me ! In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me. It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun. I found it at an outlet store.  I know it s a knock-off, but I think it ll look great on you... Zeena... The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul? Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay? Get his attention. Your wish is my command. Will he be back soon? Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery. You own this place? Yep. Then why do you call it Harlin's? Cause Harlin used to own it. But he's dead. So? Is it sleeping, dude? I think so, man. Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest. Punch it in! Absinthe? You gave then absinthe? No. Laudanum. I was talking with someone! Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn. That's what is know as "manless melancholia. Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about. Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street? Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso. Starck, why aren't you on the bridge? I just finished drying... Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on. Don't! Just let go. It's better, Mary Sue. I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ... I'm sorry, I don't know what that was. A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to. No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love. Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me. The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you? Can I have the reception desk, please. No, I mean, no big whoop. I can't do this. What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out. What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner? No, you're his wife. I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time? It don't look right. Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time. I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want. You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared. Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long. That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him. And you're drinking with them right now. And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong. What do you want? What I've always wanted, to teach you. All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you. A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death. No.  To the pain. I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase. I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon. That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me. You come all the way down here to roust-- I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas? Hey, munchkin. Dad.  What are you doing here? I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you. That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter. So how's the job going? Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist? No.  Absolutely not. All right.  All right.  We'll see. Parents say he - uh - fell - Anybody got a BP yet...? More cough syrup? Can I come in? Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred. Hi there Sarah It's about the leopard. You're worrying about its killing someone else? Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody. Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position. You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back? No. I'm quite sure. I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we? There is no news big enough. If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone - As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead. The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious. It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily - That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear. Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper - Do you have any witnesses, Major? What? What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you? Look, I didn't shoot him! We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major? Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command. Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected. Colonel, don't you know what's going on? Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper. Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs. You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk! Didn't they tell you? They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack. Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay? What was that for? I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together. You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared. Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline. Viktor! Stay the course. No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down. Endearingly absent-minded. My very point.  Here's another one... What? Can I trust you, Sami? Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room? If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing. No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead. You haven't answered my question. Does it really matter what I say? I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today. I will. You better. Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority. Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us. We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal? So what Jew would you kill first? Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild. Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo. I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock. Oh, hey - it was nothing. Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight? Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I... Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life. Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it? Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her. She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now? Sweet Jesus! Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move. My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help! I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert! ...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some. Yeah? What happened? Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him. ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly. Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much. Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack. You do the praying.  I've work ahead. There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up. What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles? You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps. Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition. Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV. Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different. How different? Toffs' game there. But not at home.     . I love you so much. I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too. Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals. I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together. How'd you people happen to pop in? We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you. Yes.  I might not have been shot. We were looking for this bird. Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed? Well... where can we go? I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly. You're scared to cancel on Daly. Damn right I'm scared. How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment. I have money. What will you do when the money runs out? It won't. Are you ready? Yes. What'll happen to us, Nell? Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please. Glad to meet you, Winifred. Nice to meet you. Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working? No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time? Eight o'clock? What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then -- Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ? No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night -- Billingsley's? Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's? It's my favorite place -- Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock. Great, bye. Bye. Can I be of service, Miss Price? Dr. Hirsch? Go about your duties. Yes, Doctor. I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you? Right. Looks like the fishing was good. Didn't I teach you to always arch your back? Yes, Master. Don't let 'im get you tight. Whatta ya think that outfit cost? How old are ya? ...What? How old? Come July, twenty-five. More like thirty. Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker. The legs must be goin'. Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years. ...Did ya fight last night? Yeah -- Did ya win? Yeah, Kayo. ...Who'd ya fight? Spider Rice. Rice is a bum. You think everybody I fight is a bum. Ain't they? Yeah! But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney. Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about  I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever. Oh yeah? Listen to me! No. It's over -- Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him? Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable. -- Eddie!! Over here. Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody. Finished, son? There's only two of them now. She's gonna use you. To protect herself. From who? Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you. Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you? She couldn't. Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 Are you alright? Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened? There's no transportation anyway this time of night. We could steal one of the choppers. I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up. She took care of the dealers... Hey, Mitch. ...pit bosses, floor managers. Thank you. But mostly... Holdin' my penis... <u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants... What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place? Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives. Now, please, Swana. Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted. That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser. Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change... Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious. What do you make of them? Shi'ites, I think. Is that good, or bad? I don't know.  They killed Wes. Why haven't they killed us!? I don't know! ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out. With what?  Against how many? We can't just sit here waiting to die. You come up with a better plan, let me know. Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us. Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more -- It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money. Joe, you know you'll -- Guess who I saw today. Who? Doctor David Ravell. What? Where was he?! ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you! Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones. Are all of you named Jones? Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it. Thank you again. Good-night. Can I see you tomorrow? Tomorrow night? Well -- Tomorrow morning. Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job. Don't go. And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas? I'll take care of you. Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks. No, Judy, you don't understand. Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night. No. No? Then what? I just want to see you as much as I can! As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"? Yes. Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen... No. That's not very complimentary, either. Sloan and I have been looking all over for you. You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short? No offense. Manray needs a job. Want to tell me what happened? I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel -- So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame. Something like that. You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are. What? Me? That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say? Well, uh... No. No? I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody -- I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week? But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to -- I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer. Well... Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're   What's that about? Forget it. Eddie, you've got to get me out of here. Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are. But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her! Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately. Like what? Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead. You son-of-a-bitch! When I left here with the money... Mm. ...I got muscled on the street. Mm. A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did. Yeah? Yeah. You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off? You and this old Indian rag-man-- Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back. And what did she die of, exactly? She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart. Oh, sure! I don't kiss. Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands. Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary... Opinion, Mister. Spock? You know, secretaries and stiff. You find people jobs? Yeah.  Is that funny? It's just more than anybody else does around here. Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it. Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House. I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator. Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore. That would be the first time. When are you going to learn? I did I killed a man. Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling. I did too. Make it yourself, or is it real? Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate. Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life. Where you from with that crazy way of talking? Crabapple Cove. Maine. Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get. Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to? C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done. We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first. He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them. Who? Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied. Aren't you gonna do something about it? Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do. I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him. Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you. It's got a big stone -- in its hand -- I think that is its hand. Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker. He will be with us. Nonetheless. Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare. Did you see anything? Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping. This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant. Give'em hell, sir ! You have him in restraints. Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet. Bloody hell! Do as I say! No. Please! Put the phone down and your hands up. What? Who is this? Toxic dumps, huh. And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge-- You sure about all this? I know him. Well? I don't think so. Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the -- --Nooo-- --Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened. A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene. Don't sweat it.  It's over. She had the baby? xxxxxx xxxxxx George, what do you think you're doing? Let me go, Bob! I wanna hear about it. Oh Jesus Christ. Are you alright? Can we rest soon? Absolutely. Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again. You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels. Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary. Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day. That's it, I'm goin'... Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you... Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife? Yes, Hi. I just wanted to be sure you were O.K. Never better. You sleep well. Yeah. I love you, honey. I love you too. Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy. Yeah, we're getting Martin. No shit, come on. How you gonna do that? I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that. I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep. Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers". I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan? Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy. So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script? Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today. Well it's a last minute change. But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes -- I lied. Wait for it... Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups. I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different. Shelly... ...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say. What about the other two? What two? Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say... ...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down... ...no... ...do you want to go downtown...? ...no... ...then... ...I only... ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...? All that I'm saying... What's that? I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however... What? It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ... Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident! Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign! It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is? What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content! Monsters in the gelatin... It's a roach, guy -- There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin... Oh, man -- What? I've no fucking cigarettes. So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely? Don't you like this? Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like. Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends? Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop? No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman. She's probably ten years older than you. Good-looking woman. Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge. Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix. Well, there's Lily. Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs? Amazing. Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out. What kind of person do you have to be to do this? Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey. I saw him... I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed. Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie. I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper. That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?! For the same reason you did, to help. Yeah, let's go. Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets. Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya. Roy?  Your clock broke. Nice going, honey.  It was brand new. I didn't break your precious clock, Roy! He had keys. Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run. I can't go back to sleep again. I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen... Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you. Shut up, and get me a hacksaw. What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon. And a missing man. Thank you. You're a nice man. I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits. There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control. Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing. Guest? We have opened a restaurant... If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one. What are you talking about, Bob? Can you use a coaster. It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too? Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up. What list? Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in. Who are you anyway? You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi. This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.? Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care. You're not in a very good mood. You don't miss a thing. How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us? That's what we're here to find out. If it happened to him, then it could... Bastard didn't even show. He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano. Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf. Yes. And now for that twentieth crack  What's wrong with me? I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best -- Give me a mirror... Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert. They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone. Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta... Joey, Joey... What? whatwhatwhat? One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it... Yes. What did you say? Well... just meet her. What. There's been some trouble downtown. What kind? What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying. Our black friends? No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message. I thought he was in prison, in England. Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you. Lemme put some clothes on. No time. My two favorite girls. Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate... It was very dark. Yes it was. What?!  She wants what?! She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights. John, what if she kidnaps him. Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions? You sure I can't go with ya? It's about to be a broken face. This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again. Must you take those? They'll be returned, miss. They are - private - letters. That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors. If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet? Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths? Where's my day book? In the den. Hello again, neighbour. I didn t intrude, did I? How are you, Jane? Fine. How was the match? Did you loose? No. Must be your lucky day then. I ve got your accounts - you don t owe much tax for last year. Good. Yes. But my boss reckons you d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It d cost you about  100 but he said it d be worth it.  Of course, you d need a partner to register. But that s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right? Uh, Sue...? I can't. What? What do you mean you -- Sue... look at your hands. I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that.... Do you know what they fought about that night he went away? I didn't know they had a fight. Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again. You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that? Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours. Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry. No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one -- No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just... It's okay. You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him. That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you. Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite. What do you want me to do? Sit. How many? Bring 'em all. Let's move! For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale? Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is. You are very sure of yourself, aren't you? Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence. I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that. A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years! Your type will soon be extinct. I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! GO!!! Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park. You know this? Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path. Just what is the lowdown on Williams? It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down. Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you. I know, I need a keeper. You're a girl. Excuse me? How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl. I guess I'm not the right kind. I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon. I was so scared. Better now, son? What'd we here, Georgie? A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley. Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing. Yeah, no mercy here. Recover any bodies? Not yet. Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em. Just in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's the understatement of the year. Yep, I suppose it is. Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher - - The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum. It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives. So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about? What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British. Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I. Billy... What the hell's wrong with you? Something... in the trees... Permission to come aboard, sir. Permission granted. May I ask, where are you bound? San Francisco.  And you? As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself. Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie... No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on. Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. What good does that do -- it's the old will? Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated. She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick. Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady. What's your being married got to do with it? It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd? It used to make me laugh .but. I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy. Yes. Frank- Frank is coming? No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me. I sure don't hate you. I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong. That's good. For science. You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics. Would you look at that? My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs... Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like? Good fighters. That's not what I meant. Was there someone special? Someone? A girl.  You know. No.  Never. I'm sorry. Hold me. Mr. Wood?! Hruphh...? Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up? Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac. I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside. What? He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit. Stay here! Don't stop working! Because I could come... To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...? How'd you get this? Boxin'. Win? Yes'm. There isn't time. Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk. Another distraction.  It's not right. Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game? Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate. I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left. All right. Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game. Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready. Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan. Football is my life. You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning. Rowan... You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back! This honey doesn't handle so good in town... No, nuh-uh, never in a million years! We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone. Maybe you should back off. This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did. You? You went by the book? Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya. Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain. Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich. I want to try. What? I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours. Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now. Now? Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house. ...Will you stay with me till they get here? Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it- All this talk about love, it's silly. You don't like me? You hate me? Are you playing tricks on me? What? It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you. I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity. What do you mean sir ? What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ? Sir ? I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century ! Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps. I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation. What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ? Do you think the assistant, what's his name... John, sir. Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ? Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen. That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable. How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing. Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four. What're you talking about? You're not here to see me? No, silly. I go here. You go where? Harvard. Law school. You got into Harvard Law? What, like it's that hard? I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen. What is it, I can't -- How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many? Oh, lots. Yeah, that's right. But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why? I see a rhetorical question on the horizon. I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver. Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way. Oh, please, Mike... Give me a break! No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it? In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations... Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here? I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone. He's dead. We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows. No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody. Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you. Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life. I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad. No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail. Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us. That's what I'm counting on. But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind. Okay. If you think it will help. Damn! What is your name? Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc. It matters to me. WILL YOU STAY? WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU? I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN. Knock it off! May as well go out under my own free will, right? Not with us in the fuckin' car! You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. . They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why? Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach. G-d, son. Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad? Your life will never be the same. Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready. We both lied to him. What do you want me to say? Just don't lie to me. Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock. Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left. What I need to <u>say</u>... <u>Yes</u>... About <u>conflict</u>... That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've... ...the, the, the symbol of the fire... The <u>Firehouse</u>... I... But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>... <u>How</u>...? Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance! No, I don't... He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>... You better hold off on the bubbly. Yeah, why? You might talk too much. Yeah and what would I say? We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m... Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>! I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER. He's upset, he's sorry. I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you? Yes...but...how did you... I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property. No ball, kid. I don't know what to say... You could tell me where you were last night. Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future? No. You ever going to bed? No. Well, I ain't sleepy either. Good. Then have a drink. No. Not me, boss. Then don't have a drink. Boss, let's get out of here. No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady. Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here. She's coming back. I know she's coming back. We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone. Shut up and go home, will you? No, sir. I'm staying right here. Quiet! What is it? I don't know.  But I think it's bad. Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?! Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ... These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes. Oh... He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory. In real life when does he hit you? My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me? Tank, you're hurt. I'll be all right. Dozer? How long will you be? Not long. Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well? I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through. Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott? Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there? Not like him. Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here! Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT. Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out. It's already out. The Police, then... Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers... Then where do we go?! I don't know. Dad, how come you know the words? Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age. Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history. They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how. I say when is now -- and we will determine how. It's either a Great White, or another killer whale. Can't you tell? Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite. Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy.... Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally. ...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat. Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them... ...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything... But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you? Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think... Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all. What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship? I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose? Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However... Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman. What do we do now? I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here. I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no. Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question? I... given the limits of your question, that's correct. The Doctors were not negligent. I... um... Come on, let's go. Something wrong? You know Overman? Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband? Goddamit... Ironic, isn't it? How are you, Raymond? Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer. All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you. If I talk to you, I will miss my ship. Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George. Steve. Thank God you came. What happened to you? Is that --? The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster. You remember me...? How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you. Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night. Oh, I'm feeling much better now. Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales -- Nick don't talk till Nick gets something. Forget it. Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives? No. But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat... You need counseling. I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I. Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me! What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh? Hi!  You didn't have to wait. That's okay, I wanted to. It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone. We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here! What's it smell like? Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate. Like Crazy Glue? Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it! Oh no. No.  Hi baby. Now I'd like to be alone. Oh.  Okay. Carl! Oh Carrrrl! Come out, come out wherever you are! Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely... ...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man. Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this! You're hung up again. I am not! What are you going to do to him? Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you. Think about it... What the fuck is wrong with you? Think about how we got here! What happened? You okay? I got seared. Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay. I got scared. It's fun!  It's high. Or the sexual habits of locusts? That was very interesting research George was doing! What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo? I already explained about that. And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai? Brian told you that? Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress. Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand. Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on. Lost! That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs. What!? With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much. That's called changing your mind. No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma. Yes I do! No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right? Oh, hi. Hi. Aren't you a little early? I brought you something ... From the library. I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck. Oh! You're supposed to fasten it! All in good time. Hi. How's it going? Can I buy you dinner sometime soon? I just got back -- I don't know which end is up. Okay. What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics... We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to... Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though... Yes. Easy now, miss, I've got you??? You've got me? Who's got you??? Do as I say. Let go! Oh, God! I'm going to die! Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon... Is this cause of me? Because of the story? Well what the hell did you think was going to happen? You never said it was off the record. I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you. I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure. So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes? Is that your Dad? Yes. Who's that with your Dad? It's my mother. Do you remember her? No. Grammoo said she's in heaven. What do you think it's like? What? Heaven. I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last. But, what if you're afraid to ride horses? It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud. That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer. ...You need to talk to me. I don't need to talk to you. I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going? Why would I care where you're going. Do you know where I'm going? ...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey -- Frank Mackey.  That's your son? that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it -- Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up. Where's your stuff? Pretty impressive, huh? It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country. From where -- Neptune? They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland. Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town. Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph. No problema.  You want a picture? What's the word on the chairs? I'm working on it. Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge. You got any money? Thought you had a man for that. I said we wasn't gonna talk about him. What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me. Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to. What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now. Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'. Forgive me. It's childish to cry. Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves. I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey? That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey? Leave that alone! Wolfi! Put it down! What is this? Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you. Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished? What? What? The vaudeville, what'd you think? Yes. Can I see it? No. Why not? Because there's nothing to see. I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry -- This is the one I like. Is this ill right? It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later. Come on! I don't want to fight you, Dignan. Barnes? That's me. Break it down to me, what's going on? Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon. Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours. Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there. Will do.  What about the distress signal? I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave. I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks... Hey, hey! I'm eating here! Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes. Don't come back, either. Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's. Fine.. Learn anything? Oh yeah. Good. What do you want, Vic? To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>. They're like beasts. Wild. Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders. Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral. Some people say children need human mothering. Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be. I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...? Uh-uh. I have. When did you begin to question Lastday? I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan? Let's see -- how long has it been? Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt. And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'. Karl, what in the world are you doing here? I want to come back and stay here. Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please. I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it. Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out? Naw. Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody? Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway. Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you? I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot. I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try? I reckon. I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history. I never was no good with history. No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable. I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him. No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. You sure you want to go through with this? What else do we do?! I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do? I don't have to. Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it. Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea. That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die. I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon. Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue - Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room. Any reserve air? Enough to breathe, but that's all. Stop it. Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile? Smith, get out of there... Come again, Skipper? One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark. I hope to God that dog is happy. Me too. Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours. Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it. Old values. Buy. So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway? I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him. You think he misses me at all? Course he does. You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out. We'll keep going, Roc. You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever. We must change our course at once. I'll take you to the bridge. Boy, to think I could maybe make my own. Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>! It's Jade Fox! We must avenge mother! What about this Nunheim? Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while. Did you know he was hanging around Julia? No. He's holding out on you. Let's go and see.  Taxi! He's not there.  But look what I found in his room Is it real? Looks real to me. Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within. They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within. Death may be the result....  Are you sure? I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child? Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey. How can we get in touch with them? In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now  Nothing. I dunno-- --you should get back into bed. I guess, yeah. Riverdale. Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not? Father... Take a letter... What? You're kidding.

It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock - You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you... I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship. Scully? Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it. Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you! But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble. You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble. You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody -- Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by? Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run. Run it then. What did you say? The driver was killed. I think there's a connection -- No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley? Yeah. Why, you know him? Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!... What?  Say again, Ma-... ...-son. What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony! We've got the real thing! Where are you now... ...Mason? I'm at mile marker... We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort. Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields... Ben's still out there -- So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly. Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend. Shut up!  Listen...maybe I can get you a year. I hate this job. What are you talking about?  You love your job. From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it. I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there? Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow. Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast. Blue, then. Blue is cold. Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... You goin' to the escort service? You got any better ideas? Mind if I ride along with you? This has nothing to do with your fire. But what if it does?  You might need my help. Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning. Okay. Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially-- Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps. Joanna said that? Or...? They revoke our flight status. Oh, I see... teamwork. Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin. That's cause we're below sea level. ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself. That's not funny. Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before? I didn't want to complicate the situation. Attraction is a complication? It can be. It happened to you before? Yes. Who was she? Someone like me, like you.  A pro. What happened to her? She was taken. Did you -- No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't. Was she the only one? After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated. Is this becoming complicated? I'm not sure that I care anymore. Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight. No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor. I do it for love. Bye Ford...'

He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>. It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell? He helped me out once.  That's all. Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing. Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>. Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself <u>What do you want</u>? Wendell, I want you to come to work for me. Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn? Well? It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you. We tried it. It didn't suit me. What happened? What did they do to her? Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood! And nobody did anything? Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on? Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant. But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule? Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules. This, this... This is bullshit! Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language! Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany! Guinan, can I leave the Nexus? Why would you want to leave? Can I? Yes, where would you go? I don't understand. I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time. I beg your pardon. All right, girls - from the top again. Anything good? Raptors, mostly. My favorite. You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed. My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps.

Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope. Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope. Well I'M certainly not, either. Neither am I. She needs to stop running around like a little boy. She's alright. How is she alright looking the way she does? Camille, she'll be fine. Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it. I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro? I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.

Okay, I think I could swing that. Were you with him last night? You're looking for Catherine, not me. Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days. You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't. I might not be able to. It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it... I haven't made a strong enough impression. Don't be too hard on yourself. It's all right. I'm proud of you, Vincent. Come on.

Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks. That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound? Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie. I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick. Are you taking them still? No, but I count them.

Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! Them? Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going. Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo". The wahoo? The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me? The wahoo moment? That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me? I think so. I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things. Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper. That's why we're here. What do you do? I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you? That depends. Hey... let him out! Do what the gentleman says, Howard. It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office. Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why? It's so nice to see a family hanging out together. We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work. You're dreamin', kid. 660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested. If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming. No. Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up? Yes. You remember that much? As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it. You've got a problem with me carrying a gun? Do me one favor    if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it. Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered -- -- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so -- Actually, you sing. Pardon? You sing.  All the time. I do not. Ask Al Auf. Alm sy asks Al Auf in Arabic. You ready? No. Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this. Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi. That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform. Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father? But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes -- I lied. Wait for it... I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table. Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom. On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him. Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run. The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you. What am I -- a dog, now? You're a musician? Yes, I thought my wife... I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector? No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in-- Good night! Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy. Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself. Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down! Maybe she didn't come here. She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through. George -- He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it. Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy. I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant? We'll take your word for it. Yeah.  Where's your truck? Are you okay? What happened? Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all. He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century. You'd never know it. I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she? No, she isn't. Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here. Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street? What are you doing here? I was lost. ...and you're not lost now? No, I... ... Bank President, three tellers and one guard... Usually on the right side as you go in. Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns. For exits off Main Street. Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards. Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of. Are you trained in the ways of the desert? No, but many consider my training valuable. I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline. Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember? It was hard to have him killed. You?  What do you mean you, I thought... It was hard to have him killed. You?  What do you mean you, I thought... It was Frankie tried to have me hit. No.  I mean, are you sure? You know otherwise, Freddie? Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman. He's done.  He's dying. Don't count on it.  We better take him out. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine. Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock. I just woke up. I'm sorry. You just woke up! Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing. Well, we ate everything without you. We? Yes, Tom Ripley's here. You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop? No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop. Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it. And I can't help having a cold. What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?! Filiba ... Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three-- Five, seven, and nine-- Yes!  Now don't worry! Worf to Picard... Yes... yes, I... can hear you... We're trying to get to you, sir... The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled. What's wrong? I have to go to the Diplomat. A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy. Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset. Which means he went toward sunrise. And what did you do? I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it. Found what? The Obliterators! The Eradicators! You got Bank Americard? What now, Sonny? Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf... Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em? Hope so.  Clean up with this boy. I don't gamble. Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid. It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble. I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash. Is this what you're looking for? Barton? What time is it? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, Garland   I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance. Okay. Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing! Spock...!  Get a fix on his position! Wasn't he at the police inquiry? He didn't want to get involved. Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence. Woody, stop it!! Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled! Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared? Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me. Did it hurt a lot? You have no idea. Alright. You want some pie? Yeah, I want some pie. Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie. You're a genius, Babe - a genius! I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around. Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you! Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay. Sure. With pay!  She is out the door. You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it. Don't panic, now, there's no rush... We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!! I can't go any farther. Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully. Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say? They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours. Where did I stop? The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra. So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that? Consigned to flames of woe. Do you believe in it? What? A fire which never dies. Burning one forever? Oh, yes. Strange! Come. Let's begin. Where's the goddamn car? You're a real case, you know that, Jack? I think we're moving. Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you... Really? No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore? I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy... Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana? Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know... So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together?

Sounds good... Oh baby. Don't go upstairs. Come with me then. This is the suitcase you gave me. I gave you? I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving. If my universe had a hub... This would be it? Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still. Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might -- Shut up. I'm all right. Think you've got enough for a search warrant now? So this is it, right? I guess. You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced? He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him. Ben -- Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body? We're working as hard as we can -- Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right. Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight. You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today. Birdy... I didn't mean to-- What'd he say? Birdy... A hundred an' thirty. That's it, I'm broke. That's it? -- Completely? That's it. What about for food an' stuff? You have my food in ya hand. It's why the witch kills children. I thought all witches were benign and good. Not this one. Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back. Obviously so. Is Frank D'Angelo around? At the bar - Sidney... I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here. Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here. Say something. What? Anything. Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong. Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit. Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy? Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang. I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart. Murman! He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you. Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us. Phil.  What are you doing? Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!! No way Phil.  Not like this. Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe... Why... her? Her body pleases me. I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do. There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady. You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance? Fine. What do you want on it? You. Would you settle for pepperoni? If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower. Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete. Decontamination -- ? And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful. Where is she? Good to see you too, Elaine. Why isn't she with you? Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private. Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times? Of course. There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that. I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you? My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b. All right. Let's take it from the top. The top of what? Name? My name? No, <u>my</u> name. I do not know your name. You play games with me and you're through I am? May I go now? So if I needed a doctor, you could be it? I could be her. Her'. My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return. Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation? Ammo! Get the ammo! I'll get it! Where is it? I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del? There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared! You never gave us a chance... I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words. Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su... Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such. He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie. Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with. Big day last night. Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself. Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words. I know.  Me neither. You should lock your doors. Ring the bell before you try the door. What's this? Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported. While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch. Look. Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine... Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy. Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science. Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read. And that will be a good place to end this study. No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group... Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical! But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor. No. See you soon. Rod says the sweetest things. He's nuts about you. Yeah, nuts.  God-... ...-damn! Okay, okay! Ah, one of them's in the back. No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'. Okay. Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid -- Where's Anna? Out to lunch with the girls. Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it. Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze? No. Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk. What's in Sandusky? Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's. We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders! You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it. Are you going to lie for him, Mother? Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there. All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen? Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty? In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question. They knocked out the external feeds. Looks like it. No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one? Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa. You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . . Maybe you wanted to. I didn't think I wanted to. Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . . That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY. As if I didn't know. I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it. Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work... What did you say? Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole. Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you. Will you defy your father and your Queen? The Queen has consented? She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief. I will do my duty, my lord. Stop it. It's all fuzzy. You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine. Why the hell not? I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood! We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent. Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian. When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do? Five times. I had it at four. This makes five. If our Executive Officer has no objections...? Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications. Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately. What's so funny? Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him. God, Fred... At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way. No? Why not? You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night. Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay? ...wouldn't let you settle it, huh? Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'... I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years. Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys. Don't the reject guys get anythin'? Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken. That don't seem fair. Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat. I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest? I slept very well. That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca. May we proceed with the business? With pleasure. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Did I hear a car? Our equipment has arrived. Hmmm. This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most. I'm getting really tired of your bullshit. My what? You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly. You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation? I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things! Okay fine. Fine? Fine what? Whatever you say Kojak. I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money. Plenty of circuits in a Walkman... I've got an idea. I was afraid of that. How'd you get here so fast? I left like an hour ago. Do you always talk weird after you violate women? Mr. Lundegaard? Huh? Yah? I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here - What... What is it all about? Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here. This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months. I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened. You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer. What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who... Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident. That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back? That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps. Wh... Where are we? Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map. Which one were you aiming at? The mother. The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each! Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think? Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs. Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet. Why would we be involved with these people? Good question. Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue. Don't tell me we gotta go back out there? If we want to kill the creature, yes. Can I help you? I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat. Well, what did you want? You have any biscuits for sale? Naw, we don't have biscuits. Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same. I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual... Slow down. Smell that? Smoke. Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents. I think we should do it. We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately. What do you mean, unfortunately? We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation. What about the other five percent? What's that? This is your party. Please? Look, look, just get off my property. They just caught the man who did it. He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance. They'll hang him all the same. Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap. Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good. Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits? Because that is what they are. Go make him happy. Love, Sire! Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that. Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry? I'm trying.  There. ... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible. It's that serious, huh? I'm afraid so. Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this. It's alright, Peter, we're fine. We are not fine. Are you from Washington originally? Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married. Oh. When did you move back? After the divorce. Oh. How long you been married? Uh... uh...  Umm... long time. You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so. No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy. Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy? Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari. Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there. No, really? Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country. We gotta jump! I can't! ...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon-- It was Big Dave's. --don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone. *I* was with her. God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you! It's me. You're fucking dead! I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker. Thank you, Fidel Castro. You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you? I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why. I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you. Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse! Where you going? Out. It's freezing. Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean. Don't touch him. Graham. Yes. What does <u>that</u> mean? I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb... Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution. If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>... ...would you use a small word? For approval. What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man. Yes. How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...? I told that woman I'm an orphan. ...you <u>are</u> an orphan. But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...? Hi, beautiful. Jesus!  Don't do that! Sorry, babe. What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him! I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk. Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt? Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists. Did she always have nightmares? They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards. I'm serious. Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me. Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids. I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you. I'm sure you would. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club. I'll need to take her things. The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa? I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind. First door up the stairs. The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half. What did you say? Do you know why you didn't make it? Because... I didn't think I would? You okay? A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights! Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here. Are you sure? Am I sure? Are you sure? Am I sure about what? Do you really want to buy those cigarettes? Are you serious? How long have you been smoking? What is this, a poll? Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should. Mm. Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them? You gotta ask <u>that</u>? Tell him his tea stinks. You tell him. When you're able. And what you going to do? Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch. I'll call the police. No, you won't. I'm terribly sorry. -- never mind. What does he do? Is he an actor? -- no. Good for you. He's a hairdresser. Does she suffer? I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing. I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"? But your man isn't quite a God! Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him. Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime! Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know... Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh... ...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I... It's okay, just leave it. I can get it. I can just... Any idea what he looks like? My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's. Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you? My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value. You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water? It's unbelievable. Think of it! In times like these. Say, what about that gold deal? Huh? Gold. You were going to  Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels. All right. One is all? For now. Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop. Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal. What did he ever do to you? He offended me with his terrible taste. It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's. Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club? Like? Sharp -- Real nice. Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine? No... Sharp -- You look great. Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey. I know about the bachelor party. I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me. I'm worried about Jake. I'm off that case. He fired me. He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what. I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal. Hey man. We're casting for an explicit sex action feature... I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone. That's not true, Mr...? Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim. That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for. I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you. Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling. I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you? My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it. I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here. I'll come a-running, pardner. He has children? Once... When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people? I'm saying don't do it accidently. Oh yeah.  Accidently. Where are we going? I do not know.  Away. Where are we running?  What am I missing here? Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head! That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth! Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A. I object. How do I offend, my lord? By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name? Christopher Marlowe at your service. That's it, It's go time. Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it. Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah. For God's sake, when does this end?! Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School. Like you care. I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s . I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t. He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens - Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list. He is. Where'd you get the money, huh? We ain't got it. We ain't got no money. You told them cowboys you had it. We was... lyin'. What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS! You don't have to come here. Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business. What happened? Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett. Is he going to be okay? I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter - Honest? All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots. Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back. There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before. This is a waste of time. We're focusing. I know, I know... focusing on one little thing. The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen. Where you from Walter? Vernon, Florida. Never heard of it, any huntin'? Turkey mostly. Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think... Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going. Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain. There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes. Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's. Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask? Whether crabs are in season there now... Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night. Answer the man. Nothing, just tourist souvenirs. That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway. Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective? Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried. You were wonderful! Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff? Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir. Primary bomb is live. All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run. Master safety on. I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted. Not quite. Hard to get up in the morning, huh? That's right. How' you doin', Barney? You gotta promise to feed her. I will. Fresh goat's milk. Absolutely! Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters... Shit... Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about? InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it? Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?! Listen... Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it? What you gonna do back there, East? Lotta rich women back there... Yeah? Men, they mostly faggots. Must be some mess back there. Well, ain't no use hanging around here. Ain't gonna collect your pay? I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige! Do you have music up there? Yes. I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something? I do not want to. Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it. Who said that? I did, sir. What crime did you commit. The accidental killing of a person, sir. Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable! Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable? How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'. What's the award? What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award! Me? What if she don't want me? If she don't want you, she don't get anything. You're teasing me again! Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow! You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers. Listen, Johnny  Go on  beat it. Don't push your luck. You want to know somethin' ? I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it. This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something. What? Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall? LOKI! Where did YOU come from? Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans. Yes. I just got busy. That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message. You crazy? With all those people around? Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper. The hell I am! Prude. First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way. Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now? Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president? Who the hell is he? I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS! HOLD it! HOLD it in! DEATH TO DRAGONS! Thank you. I have to talk to you. Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse... Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what? Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious! You mean Louis Armstrong? He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town. Oh my god. Griffin. You know him? -- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you. Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night? Well try, okay? I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open. Sal -- Yeah? Don't forget anchovies. Well... Oh come on, Pitts... My hair's getting wet! So's mine. That's gotta kill him, right? Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally. Outpost doesn't own em. Where are you? I'm here. And it snuffled the ground like a dog. Like this. Okay. Where are you going vit the light? I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse? Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light. I know not. Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed. Your book.  Your Herodotus! Alm sy looks uncomfortable. It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior - When was that? The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away. Sister Paul? Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room. Who'd ever think, to look at you? As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you. You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call? We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me. How did you know? I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder. That film was a fake! Everything's phony... Ratan! Be careful! Be careful! Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b... Thanks, but it's under control. What -- happened here. Charlie? NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault. Bernie -- this is Anna. Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you. I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass... End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared. Let my Susie rest in peace! Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions. That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss. Officer White? A sweet man. Under the house. All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there. No, no, it's not. It's better. Better? This is my uncle's barn in Iowa. What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?! No... Could you? No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment. The what? Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides... What? Can we talk?  Just for a minute? Can't it wait till morning? Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone. Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye. Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot. Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about. What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm? Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice. Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank... Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this. I should'a been a fucking mailman. What are you boys up to? Same old shit. Why? No, don't! Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane. Thank you sir! Thank you! No, sir! We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people. Maybe you ought to buy me one. Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back. You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering -- I wouldn't know anything about that. I mean... Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...? You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy? The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out. Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer. Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment. What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy? Never met him. Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine. Amen to that. ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus! The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time. You don't think there's much time left, do you? That's not what I said. You're scared. You think we're near the end. No. Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable. Maybe you should think about it. What's that mean?! Maybe you should think about it. I'm not going to die. That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness. You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>? Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK! I'm not ready to die. Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it! Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls. Can't you please finish your drink? Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in. Not likely!  Where are the speeders? We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ... We'll have to go out on Tauntauns. The temperature is dropping too fast. You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it. Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live... Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"? Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live. You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent. Of course. You look so, so... ... so much like her? Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right. I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky. Norman! Get this thing off me. That's going to be fun. Some people like it. Madame... ... And his friend, Johana... We'll be ready Adam. I know you'll be.  Three hours. But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight -- Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock". What's wrong? Don't let them take me, Steve -- I won't let anybody take you. I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again. I'd a found you, Ma. I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together. Nicky sends his warmest regards. What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go. You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*. What sort of injury did he have? Ah he dislocated his shoulder. Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive. What makes you think I was the last one? You always do this to me. Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita. Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there... -- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him... He's been tested for drugs? Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that? We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers... Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies... Now's a helluva time to play "what if". This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught. What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight? Astronomical. Stop it! Just cut it out! You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*! For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down! Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you? I've been great. And you? Two minutes, Alvy. No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle. In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish. You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next- Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in. Yes. Yes, what? Yes, I'll have dinner with you. What's goin' on? Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so. A baby... and she isn't even married. That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it. If it isn't a baby... what is it? I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world. Yeah. Good bye. Who is it? I'm at the door. Go way. I'll call a cop. Pop, will you let me in? Where the hell are you? Right here. At the door. Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks. No.  I'm fine. It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you. Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look. He asked me to see were you all right. What the hell? Yoo hoo, bomb... Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you. I don't know what to think anymore. Just think about one thing right now: What color? Then why are you teaching me...? Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid. We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it... ...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler. Personal ads? Why does this have to be so hard... Tell me about it... A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them. We could do that. But when he had them there, then what? Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest. Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ... Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad. You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear... I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree. Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me! I don't know.  Fuck off! Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now. I know. You know. I know the guy leaves a sign. These are great. Aren't they? How much for these five? You should talk to him about this. What is it? I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later. What do we do? Wait. What if they get in here? They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't. I heard you. Feel okay? Yeah. Shaky? Nope. Chills? Huh uh. It's a tradition. I know, Dad. I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair... You went berserk... I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald... So did your father... So did my father and his father before him. But it's a responsibility... But it's a responsibility being a Berserk. I must only let the red rage... You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle. I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES! I pushed him too hard. You couldn't have known -- Yeah, I could've. Should've. You wanted to get the truth. No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy. You mean the falsely accused? He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust... Like family, huh? Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too. I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to. Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards. That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me. Who is? They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind. You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do? I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein. More romances for John? Hmmm? ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening. Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said. Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you? That I am very little different from him. Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you. But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous? Frederick, just what is it that you are saying? ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man? Oh Frederick. Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that? Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes... There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes. Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey. Would we see the flash? Through three miles of water?   I don't know. Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness. You better not have too much joy. Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're... Gonna get married... Did you hear me, sir, because -- Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now! What is it?  What's the matter? Mike's out there. I didn't mean to hit you. I know that. Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name. I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed? No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think? No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace. I agree... Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me. I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing. Verdell? You've got your orders. This ain't Bangkok, chief. You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know. I know... Thank you, 'Mam. Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect? I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun. I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting! And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or... Does that mean suck my dick? Whaddaya got, Nolan? Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in. How long has she been dead? Six, eight hours tops. Any sign of rape? Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle. Futterman? He just couldn't wait... Whatchu doin'?... ...this is a snappy song.... What'd ya think? Czar for life, just like a real czar. That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia. Does it hurt? Haven't you got a bullet I can bite? This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it. She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off? I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run. Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me. With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are? No. Does she know where she's going? What's the code, Travers? I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals. Give me the fucking code! Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out? He won't. He thinks I'm simple. Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares. Oh... We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away. Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene. She's in the holding cell, on this floor. You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut! You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated? Highly, highly overrated. It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski? Dude. Huh? I don't know, sir. Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man? Sure.  That and a pair of testicles. Your Majesty... What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now? You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before. Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it! But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all! Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction. I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act? There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world! My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre? Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely! Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy! No... . . .For his own good. Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself. Vernon. Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun. Who's got a gun? You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it! Relax, Vernon... I know. What went down between you and Riviera? Hey, piss-head, what brings you around? You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too. At least I improved myself. What's up? Well, your condition's pretty serious. [Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What? I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable? Depends on what you're seeing. Put your napkins in your laps and eat up. How come you're not eating? Can I pour you one? Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit. So what's the plan? The plan is... you go. Me? My ankle. Just go explain the situation. Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering... Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that. No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--? Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered. Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides-- Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me! I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay? Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show? They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times. I need a new PR guy. Aw, now that s gonna take time to clear! Take it or leave it. I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin? Aspirin. He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke-- Yech... That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write. And pay for their drinks occasionally. We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO. I'm sorry, Stanley. Well why do you -- why do you think that? Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours. Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do? Not if you don't want to. I do. But I don't want you to make up something. I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after -- Goodnight, Benjamin. You believe me, don't you? No. You don't? Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--! He did it. Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week. So? Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh. Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score! Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond. Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs. Must have been all the liquor in him. Quiet please. It's a spittin' image. Doesn't look anything like her to me. Pictures don't lie. Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way. It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right? The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears. How long will that be? Something else? Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it? No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt.. It scales, don't you think? Definitely. It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire. Four shootings in five years.  All accidents. They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop. It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel! Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. My fault. You're not hurt, are you? I don't think so. I wish you'd make sure. Why? Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars. Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. Thank you. Who are you? Now, really - Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table? My liege,  I am honored. We have a lot in common. You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there? Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet. Of course not. You could help us. I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league. If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. You're all safe. Thanks be to God! Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose! Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think? And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture? George?  What do you know about cocaine? I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive. No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty. Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work. That's good. And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop. Yes, you said. Now, are you going to have some more tea? No, thanks Dad. Or a beer.  I've got some in. Rizzo, he's out there. Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance. This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation. You don't think God'll mind, do you? Maybe some of us don't need this crap! And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope. Our life in a nutshell... If you want to look at it that way... How would you look at it? Hey, Carl, what's wrong ? Did you get Starside R&D ? Where are you? A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night. When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire? I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda? I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here... Gee.  Thanks. Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me. YOU HURT ME. I WILL PROTECT YOU. You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited. Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you. You- Do you love me? Do I love you? That's the key question. Yeah. I know you've only known me a short while. Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me? I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what... Yeah. I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you. Yeah. Don't you think I do? I dunno. Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her! I-I'm sorry, Sam. You've got to stop her. What can I do? She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders- Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants! If any! Yes, let the joyous news be spread. What's wrong? Nothing could be better... There may be two... no, three who could fit it. Names. Spice!... pure un-refined spice! Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world. Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater. He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down. What are we going to do? Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us. We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan? Um hm.  That's right, Maya. So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan... Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted. You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed. Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world. If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town. I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl. Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid? Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before -- Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do. Stay away from me, Wendy! Stay away...! Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in. I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard! Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat? That's what the guy said. Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat. Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready. All right. I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all. Don't need none. Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more. Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk. Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way. Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to... Get us out of here... Nicholas... Get us out! No. Talking about it as a... No. As a robbery. As a "robbery"?!  No. Well.  Well... Hey. Answer your mother. Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay? Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry! That's Daddy! Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come. Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys. B'bye. Rose. Kitty... Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham. Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon. Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you. Beg pardon? Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip. But now you can't go. Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go. Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York... Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor. It was Freddy. Enough of that crap. I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in... Why did you set me up? I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone. Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that? I had to get away!  My life was in danger! Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy? No.  A witness. What exactly did you see? Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it... No, but I'm listening. I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened. Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room? Yeah...they did.  One girl... Good golly miss molly you are looking good today ! Thank you. I meant him. Yes. When? Tomorrow. Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him? No. Jill, say hello to Felicia. Hello. Forget it, it'll never work. Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres. After the kids are back in school. Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents. When did you get out of jail? Four days ago. Where at? Susanville. How long? Two months shy of four years. Four years? Uh-huh. What for? Bank robbery. Really, I'm impressed. Do you have to work tonight? No. Neither do I. Yeah? Have you pulled yourself together? ...Not yet. Should I stay? It's a beautiful city. I'll come with you. Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own. Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately. It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell! They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going? There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor? Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower. Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code? Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway. You're compulsive. Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people. Why's that? Long story. Not that interesting. Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed. I'm pregnant. Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating. What the fuck are you talking about? That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s. I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong. I'm not going to report it. Have you ever known anybody a long time? You mean a woman? Uh-huh. What's a long time? Ten years. Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long. He's preaching. Punishing. The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship. Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante. Did you read them? Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned... Seven Terraces of Purgation. Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order. For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition. Forced what? Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God. Like, because someone's holding a gun on you. It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it? Nope. What?! You better come see this. Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed? And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis. Hey... Sheila. What's the BITCH'S name?! Look Sheila... I'm sorry... YOU'RE SORRY!! Go home, Sheila. This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family. The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that? Where do you live? You're not a stalker or anything, right? Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no. You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that. I'm not a stalker. You know Wilmont? Yeah. Wilmont. Near the high school. We can try again. Everybody take five. How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't. I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport. We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor. Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team. Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you! You wouldn't hit a girl, would you? I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them? None of them had any -- Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't... What's wrong? I don't remember.  Why don't I remember? Sounds like Tick's already celebrating. You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up! Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together. So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her. Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town. ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances? ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one... What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want. Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict. Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it. And I can't help having a cold. What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?! Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface. Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status? Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed. Go to manual. Why are you so agitated? I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too. He backed down. He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear. What are you going to do? I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head. Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too. I never said do what I do, I said do what I say. Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won? It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet. My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it. Surely you knew this was coming. War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children! He didn't see you, did he? No. See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way! This is insane! Knock it off, Damone. I need real help. What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free. ...Hello? Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you. You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up. You know, you could work in a wine store. Yeah, that would be a good move. I don't want you to leave tomorrow. I don't understand. I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan. But Elaine -- Goodbye. Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor. Just three people in a room this size? Whew! I wouldn't do that. Do what? So, where are you from? Get lost. Let me hold him. O.K. Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours... I might have to look into that... So, you're not a dyke. Not tonight.  Do you? Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if  C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie. Mister Se or Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina. Alright.  Let me play this record while I go to work on my chicken Parmigiana hero with extra cheese and extra sauce. I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...? I'm glad you're around to say it. My jury's still out on that, Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..? Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were? She said they were from her old convent. But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent. What are the terms? If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine. And if I win? I thought we came here to play pool. I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to. Up an' at 'em, Taber. What's going on? Shhhh. Time to say goodbye. You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>. Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass? Flight got you nervous? There's a problem, Lamar. Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here. Something's happened to them. It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them. All of them? Richter!  Call from Cohaagen. This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down. Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean? Yes, I believe I do. And what would that be? Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five. You're taking this too far, Drew. Am I not obligated to? Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? Is it about my teeth? Yes. Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon? I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem. I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train. Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man. I do. Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together? Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted. Jesus Christ! Jesus. That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you. Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy. Bet I do. You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it. What is it? Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads. Only holds five. Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one. No... two. Yeah, he's funny that way. I... What's your favorite sport, Hawk? Baseball, why? Thanks for the backup. How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on? He's mine? All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had. But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm against that. We've got to get out of this shower. Now you're making sense. Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ... There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast. Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating? Carrots. Raw? Uh-huh. Want one? No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat. You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me goodnight! I hate the horrid stuff. You're crazy. How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail? Not bad enough to kill him. Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight... Vital signs have stabilized. That's good. Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances? He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see. But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right? I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you? Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage. Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas? Sure, great if you ain't married. How about if I try humility. How about if you try disappearing. Ed, who is Daniel Davis? Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses. So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now. Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up. I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day. Farrah. Come here. Where is it! Please! AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH! Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address. No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces. The cops could trace this call back to you. One of them <u>is</u> a cop. What makes you say that? He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license -- Who? Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick. Oh man.  These people mean business. Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it. Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute. Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you! It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that. I look like fuckin' Chewbacca. Your shot. You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man? That's what the game's all about. Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket. What?  Say again, Ma-... ...-son. What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony! We've got the real thing! Where are you now... ...Mason? I'm at mile marker... 53. 53! I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass. I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous. Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to... I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas. Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas? You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way. I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas! Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand? No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened? You got about thirty seconds. I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me. Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass. I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized What? I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you... Whatever.  I'll take my food to go... Jesus. And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG! ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. Matter of fact... I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian. Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me. What new information? Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip? No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving? Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon. I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him. Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl. A little. Not much. This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we? He feels he has to defend himself if necessary. I'm actually beginning to enjoy this. This photo you took of "Spider-Man" - Luck.  The right place at the right time. Really.  I'd like to speak with him. I don't think I'll be running into him. You never know.  Go get some sleep. I'll try. Thanks. ...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day... I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for? Not until Ben is back inside! It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us. How do you feel about getting old? You're not old. You look great. I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you? It's not really something I think about. Really? Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it. How'd you feel about it? I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me. It's different with men. You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department. Are you all right? AH UGH. Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there? I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ. Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife? You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding. Maybe I am dealing with it. I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ... And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite... Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow! Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is. And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now. Well? It didn't work, Vince. You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot. Pumpkin? What's wrong? Nothing. That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey? Yes. Chauncey is fine. And I'm Ben. My job is here. Me too. Bread? Thank you. When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer? She's being called for. You said you'd call my father. Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy. What is this? This is water? It's a mouse trap. And this? Sull!  What the hell! I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad. We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions. All prop cars accounted for? He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear. What the fuck are we going to do? Hide him. To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes. As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well. As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month. Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow. Do they have to look so...robotic? At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about? When we had trouble before it was different. You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things What do you want to do? Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you. Do you mean that? I mean it. What about the sheriff's task force? Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse. If I could be of any help... I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal. Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky? Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap? You're getting out of the business? Have to get these wet things off. You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving! No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas. Gas good? Yes. Very good. This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could... What are you <u>doing</u> tonight? Me? Yes. Well... Don't. I know what you're going to say. No, really, Sara, I don't think you -- You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her. I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me. She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby. Mulholland Drive. Mulholland Drive? That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive. Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call. No.... I don't... We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident. What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything. They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken. Gee. Spencer of the Chronicle . Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening. Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ... I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do. You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this. And you don't want to keep him waiting. That's right.  I don't. He owned the water department? Yes. He owned the entire water supply for the city? Yes. How did they get it away from him? Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display. Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department. Along with Mr. Mulwray. They were partners. Yes. Yes, they were partners. ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy. Sorry, I just didn't remember. Good morning. Good morning. Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive. Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up. I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ? Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago. Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future. My God! It's beautiful! Tell me... I love you... ....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh? Yes. You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money.... ....Why does he do it...? Cause he hates me....he hates me so much. It's not right. I hate it. Are your parents alive? Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them! Don't say that. Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use. That's what we thought. Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through? Done it already.  Nothing matches. Howard, they've disappeared again. Oh dear. Do you love your father? Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy. Do you love him? Is everything okay at work? Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent. You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you? I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom. Why? Because she won't sleep with you? Where did you hear that? I'm just guessing. Well... it's true. Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend. If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now. Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement? Fascinated. I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon. Sometimes every day, for a while. Then you don't see him for a few days? You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives! That land belongs to the strongest. Did you feel that? Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years. Not that. Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03. See? Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera. Howdy, Rhonda. You're really leaving, huh? You bet.  You gonna be staying up here? Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up. Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren. Sure. Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture? Not particularly. It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off. Sure -- take him to the vet. I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days. Do it. Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to -- Get out. Carol! Peggy Sue! Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay. I'll get my car and be back in half an hour. Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up! An hour? Mmm. Okay. It's incredible! How did you do it? What? There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it? I hate sucking dick! Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear. And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging. Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever. Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it. And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know. What? What are you doing? What are you doing here? John? Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work. Barker.  Jock Barker? Baker.  Jack Baker. Right.  Bring him back. Come on, Ed. Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God. He talked to you Himself? No. Through someone else? Yes. Who? I can't say. Why? She'd punish me. One of the other Sisters? No. Who? And what do we do when we find it? We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it. Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours. This is taking forever.  I'm starving. That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win. My ass. Yeah, that's fat too. You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself! Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here. The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants! What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it. I guess we need to talk. I guess so. It's hard to know where to start. The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces. I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica. I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy. I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew. Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six. Billy, that's too early. She said she's got to be home by nine. Can't you make it later? There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word. M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y. Okay. Never argue with a man. Y -- what in hell starts with Y? Why are you whispering? I can't really talk right now. What did you find? Evidence of a massive infection. What kind of infection? I don't know. Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too. Mulder -- I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by. I've got a hearing tomorrow -- -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away. Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here -- What are your plans now, Mr. Chance? I would like to stay and work in my garden. Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we re doing here? How come you re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise? Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem... You are --? ...Yes -- Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle. Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet. The suit needs it more than I do, anyway. How often do you go through this little ritual? You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me. They may nail me into this now, McCoy. That's your problem. You know, you and I may be two of a kind. No way. I always do my own work. It's gonna be beautiful. Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'? Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name. What difference does it make? There has to be. I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels. There must be half a million dollars here though. You got everything you ever wanted. Except the girl. The only one that really mattered. Let's get out of here. Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say... God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones. Okay, now, how far's your truck? It could be a man. It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies. She staying with you? We haven't located her Dad yet. How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that! I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore. There.  All done.  Lift me down. What? Lift me down. You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie. Huh? They tore her dress! ... We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month! Yeah?! That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month. Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance. Do you really think he'll show up? Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word. Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit. So how can we get to it? The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being... Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic? About what? Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out! I don't think so. She's not in an ambulance Father. Why not? See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two. Pinned? What does that mean? What is it...? It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction. Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit? I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out. Not these guys. Yeah, those guys too. Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk? Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan! Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long. Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat. Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go? Can we get some coffee...? How ya doing? ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest. And the next one...? From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's. And the last...? Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect. Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's. I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already. Hot chocolate? We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea. Then you have some hot tea? No. Oh. But I can heat some up for you if you'd like. Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip. I'm just too old for going steady, Josh. So's he and he knows it. Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground -- Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money. Steal it how? By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked. May I have a cigarette, please? Swing up, son. What? Up you go.  Right now. Piggyback ride. I don't mind. If you think he can hold me. Sure! No. I'm serious about this. Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then. Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff. You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked. Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire. Yeah, it was once. You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world. No I don't. In the world. I know you just want to punish me -- I do. I want to very badly. So you're just going to be vindictive In every sense. If at all possible. You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already. Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash. I'd strongly advise you to join us-- --before you lose your emotional lunch. Good afternoon! What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts. I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up. This is so good of you. Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money? Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife. God, you're so young. Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes! Be sensible, Martins. I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway. You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones. Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village. First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in. Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us -- Wrong on both counts. You're in over your head. I know. So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend. I understand. Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this. I know. I'll talk to the Mayor. That'll make the folks very happy. It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face? Maybe because you're looking her in the face. A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death. No.  To the pain. I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase. I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon. That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me. That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure. Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter. I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle. I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago. A long time, with one man. Not working for someone like Dr. Duval -- ...walk? Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up. Hello? Dickie? Who is it? It's Freddie. Let me in. You know what I'm thinking? What's that? I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time. Uh-huh. What are you doing? Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite. Get out. If you'll just let me - She'll come back. No, she won't. Why would you let her to do that? It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me. You fucking bastard... Whose side are you on? Kiss her you fool. Her? No -- don't cry -- GET OUT! Don't cry. Get out of here. To be quite honest it turns my stomach. Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution. Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me - Why? Why what? Why is she gonna get angry with you? What's the Boom Boom Room? That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town. You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud. Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement. Keep your three o'clock. Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to -- I said keep it. I don't know anything about these papers, sir. They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said. Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ? Right now -- I am. Well who the hell verifies that ? I do. So where's Buckaroo? Whadda you need Buckaroo for? In English.   Sami doesn't speak French. Where are you from? What are they for? They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet. If there was a problem, they could do something right? Of course, that's what they're for. Yeah? Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives. Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit. If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald. The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion... Carmen...? Excuse me...! I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again. I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart. Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...? Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife. Thank you, sir. But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today. Yeah, hello. Is David Dunne there? Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout? He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife. And you agreed? Yes. Why? You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line. My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs. There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career. Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty. We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time. See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty. What's your cost? As low as two. Are you serious? That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in. You're not going to play it again. Well, lemme play the other side then. No. I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more! I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound! And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind! What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo? I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow! You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go. Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there. Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed. What? We are immortal. What honey? Fuck it. If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here.... And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps. I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me. What happened down there? He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep. What did you do? I'm always bad. What did you do? I breathed! You're on fire! Not this again -- No: You're ON FIRE! I know what he says. Shut up.  Go on. I'd hate her to grow up like that. She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child. There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed. It's wonderful. To most people, it's an awful letdown. Huh? I say, to most people it's a washout. That depends on what they see. Now, what do you see? Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President   Things like that can only happen in a country like America. Look. Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much. You? Yes, Amy. But why? Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity. But will he... ? Your daddy will always love you. How do you know? I know because... it's just something I know. I don't want to hurt my daddy. Robin, listen to me. Hey! Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time. How much time? Time. What time is it now? Twenty-after-ten. Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already. Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . . Cowards!  Twenty run from four?! The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain. Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him. Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy. Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life? Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court. Won or lost? Lost. Someday, Dick. So what do you keep in there? Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office. Everything? Everything. Just for the record. She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend. South African women are very sporty. Afraid so. That's a big book you're writing. I think it's sort of writing itself at this point. Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but -- But... ? Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were... Washed up? Blocked. Ah. I don't believe in writer's block. Thelma, if I die-- What? I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should-- Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that! Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy? Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?! I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him.  I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you.  You're a good mother. I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you? We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich -- It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink. In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters. I'm entertaining you now, aren't I? I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption. Don't be so sure. Yes. All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way. He wasn't feeling well. He's a pussy. I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead. Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>. Do you live around here? Yeah. When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high? You know I love you... yeah? Yes. You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you? We loved each other, do you mean that? Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows. It's libelous; you wouldn't dare. And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own. ...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey? She's dead, Barton! If that was her name. Unfinished business. Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie. Who's she? It could be fun. Yeah... It could be fun. Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron! Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal -- -- water! -- -- and your meat shall be de-boned. What is it? It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal. Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc. Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in. You'll be able to find your way back, won't you? Oh, yes. Will I be seeing you again? San Francisco's a long way from here. I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim. How does Mother know what I like to do? I guess she and I read the same gossip columns. Oh. That. Rome. Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very... In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain. Without any clothes on? With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said... You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh? I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular... The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd... Yes, but... ...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or... Yes. ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth? Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too. Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth? No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here. So you didn't go to school together. No. And you didn't come up here to see her. No. You were lying. Yes, I was lying. Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too? I wrote the letter. What did it say? It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said. But you tore it up. Yes. Why? Because it seemed stupid and foolish. Like jumping into a fountain in Rome! I told you what happened in Rome! Do you expect me to believe...? I don't give a damn what you believe! You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day. Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great. Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk! Feels different doesn't it? What? That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left. What was that? Anonymous. See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest. But what if the play was a hit? Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it? Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop. What scheme? What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius. Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought. Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts! Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it? I guess so.  You're a doctor? ...Need a hand with those bags? No, thanks, I can manage. Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow. And what do you want out of this? A peaceful and prosperous retirement. Jeanne... what are you doing? Playing... You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail! I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John. What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger. Thanks. Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John. Your life will never be the same. Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready. We both lied to him. What do you want me to say? Just don't lie to me. It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S. I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad. You remember what I said about the Vitamins. They're saying you killed that policeman. That's gonna end tonight. Who are you? Miss Harrington... What are you doing here? I - I guess I fell asleep. Yes? How's Broussard? He's running a fever. Still unconscious? Yes. Can you do anything for him? The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong. Good. Don't give it to me. Don't! Oooh! Here! Here! Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus! Get him! Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot. I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water. Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies? Hi. Sarah Knottingham. You know her? I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go. HE'?  Whom do you mean- And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo? Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad. Let's go the zoo. Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76. You get a translator, Captain? I've got a line on one. Schnapps... Peppermint... alright. Jesus, this place is packed. We had a run in the mass murder section. You coming tonight? Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste. What? Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud. Again How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy? Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we? You bet we did. It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going. Whatever you say, darling. I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. Time for you to get off, Ma'am. Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard! Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity. A common thief. A patriot! I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain? This way's perfect. Thanks to you, Nate. Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance. I can see you're real concerned about your daughter. Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone. Well, I'll think it over. You're running out of time. I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is. Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that? From my dad's side of the family. What brings you out to the sticks? Had a package to deliver. You?  Personally? I had it on the island with me. Must be a story there. Have they ever been busted? No. It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core. Its core? You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk. Listen to me -- you men and women -- Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze? I've never even met Admiral Kirk -- Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us? I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence. It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside. I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life... Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here. ...yeah... I'm sorry, I had to get dressed. Did he give any reason? He suggested I ask you. Ask me? Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that. Do you hear anything? Only silence. It's always like this. And no birds sing. No birds live here. No. That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife? There's a compass in the handle. It floated back up.  I had to take him out and -- NO! A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning... Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you. Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me. Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm? Maybe. It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm? Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take.. Right after we played backgammon. We played backgammon? Uh huh. You beat me three times. I did? Yep. Then I fucked your daughter. Excuse me? We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel. A window onto the human condition? I prefer to think of it as a mirror. I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God. Just take deep breaths. All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something. You can't come in. What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember? You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense. Fuck no. I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want. We'll exterminate the fuckers ! I can give myself a headache instantly. Is that like a party trick? All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits. The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling. And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table? There is a medical explanation for everything that happened. You heard voices, you know you did. Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men! I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers. <u>How</u>? It's time for drastic remedies. Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets. It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station. Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath? ... okay... you made your point. Post Office. Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say? Once ONI, always ONI"? Twenty-five dollars. Okay, Harding, you're on. Okay, sucker. Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen! Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail! What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing. Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway. He never answers. Why does he have a lock on his door? Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore! Nice... It's something Users do. Where's Flynn? Gabe...your arm? Yeah? If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it? Sure, just give it back when you're done. I have had command for the last time  - Come  - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island. I shall not leave the island    Pike and I got separated -- Yeah and he doesn't know when -- I remember now, it was before the explosion -- Oh, you remember now -- I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly -- May I please see the storage facility? Why do you want to see it? Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order. Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution. Have it your way, Mr. Venkman. Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree! Tell me your name. Ann Bishop Millaney. Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath. I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail. Yes! This time we got it right! It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said. As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right? Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that. Help me out, will you? What can I do? You're on your own. Uhhh... teeth. Teeth. Sorry. I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening. Why? Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them. Nobody's asking you to. And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it! I sat outside and had coffee. Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church? Near the church. I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by... Excuse me, what about the job? Pardon? I need the job. Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh... Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common. You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone. Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal. Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the.... I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks. Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to. Mary Robert. Do you mind if I sit? Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in... I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance. Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back. So who left who? She left me. Why? She saw through me. Uh-oh.  That's not good. Push her, c'mon. I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her. Just passing through the night. What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely. Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you. I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor. You got something in mind, Blade? Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night. That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too -- Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either? No, thank heaven. Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest! We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko. Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for... About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I... What are these? Videotapes. I can see that. What are they? The kids are in here! Where's the office? Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later! Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey. Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there. See that wasn't so bad. It was nothing. Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is. Okay. Eyes closed. Get closer!  Don't lose him! I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming. Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White. Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished. Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection. What? The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should... I tested positive? I'm sorry. But I only had sex with Telly. Well, not exactly s... Why does Rachel scream? Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil. I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser? It's not your job. He was my partner. They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner! I planned on catching him, Captain. How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane. He killed a police officer. Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period. I heard ya lady is wild. No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit. Oh, because on our first date, she let me... ...no, she didn't... ...yes she did. ...I heard different, thought that was... ...not that time... So when are you comin' to pick us up? Around... ...too early... ...then what about... ...too late, maybe around... ...perfect... That's what I like about you and me. We git along... ...like macaroni and cheese... ...like grits and butter... ...like fried and chicken... Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry. This is easy--I'm not hurrying. You still doin' it too fast! No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie? Doucet killed my partner. Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone? No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more. You want me to take you somewhere? Long as it's fun. Who's first? Anyone like a wing? Yours, or the turkeys? I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two? That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate. I don't know, with this case. If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight. Have we met? No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer. Ahh, the luxuries of life. Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me. Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit. And I'm the feet. Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing. I'm tired of waiting. I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is. The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care. You sure have a way with people. Well, they're my species. That was sure swell ... Oh. Thanks, Margaret. I baked you my oatmeal cookies. Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey. No. I baked them for you. No. You baked them for Whitey. No. I baked them for you. ... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason. Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation... He is the situation. Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father? Yes. Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends. My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer. Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried. But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired? Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation. That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well. Yes -- that's right. What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying? You sure you got ever'thing ready? Ain't gonna be no trouble. You ain't to hurt them fellas. I'm sorry I got you into this. It was my choice. Maybe you should have just a half. Thanks for the advice dad. I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime -- -- my loss -- -- even if I give you a million as well? Wouldn't know what to do with it all -- There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually. I really think we should go back... I want to look at the rest of the house. I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out. You heard the Sergeant. Outside. They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it? No, no they know another track - to the side of this. Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...? Now there's a poser. Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know. Hell yeah, they don't know. Dad, what the hell is going on? Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away. What's that comin' from the bar? Sounds like singin'. Oh, no... What the hell's going on? I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew. You have the body? She's buried. I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota? Winona. I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes. I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you. Anything... anything missing or different. I don't see anything. Are you absolutely certain? I can't do this now... please. Alright. Alright... Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar. This is no time to celebrate! Just keep your eyes on the road. Hello. Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there? Yes, she is. Will you get her for me? She's washing her clothes. Well, go tell her it's me, okay? Okay. You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about. No way. Oh Billy... Please... God... I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay... He's here. He's trying to kill me... It's legitimate. Worth pursuing? Was that supposed to be me? No. Yes. What's wr--? The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement. Any word? Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town. I did at that. And but for a mark you are well as any man, no? Aye. I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution. What about the car? Let's walk. Who are they? It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here. Thanks again, Sam. I'm glad it's okay. It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.] Johnny.  SUPERNOVA. But all these people... <u>Now</u>. John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world... There's some good things on it, though. Pardon me? The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes. I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media... Your health... Ta ss'trakyona'... Somewhere near the capital? No maglev system. The mall? Georgetown. Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard. Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me. What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please. I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them. Where are you going? Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there. Good morning, Cheeba. Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot. De-la-croix. Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet? I need to work out some stuff. You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me. I still see that boy's eyes. How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day. I don't know. The hell you don't. Five million? You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now? Christmas... Eve... You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how. Really Bond, couldn t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears? What s your business with Elektra King? I thought you were the one in her business. She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for? As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks. What are you laughing at? I don't know, I think he's funny. This isn't funny, it's twisted. Did you tell them that I flooded the school? I didn't say shit. That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it. Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about. You know what? I think that you did it. One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts. They had to kill 'em? Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted. That's a good story. So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything. He was married? At first. You got anybody, Wick? Not me.  You? A match made in heaven. See?  You big dullard. I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them. Ummm. Have you considered my offer? You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King... Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>. What?  What do you mean you -- Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>. No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there. Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me. Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips. Thank you. She had a moustache. She was European! All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman -- Edith was just telling me about her job. I'm a file clerk. Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain. Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet... She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed. Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred... Did you have to use that much explosive? I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes. It's going to take time, Walter. Time. How do you feel about that? I feel... okay. Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage. Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie -- Good.  Are those foods? Fabric and fringe. Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit -- Miles. I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so -- Thanks for the great time. What is this? Long story. I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things. How is it back there? I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you. This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it... I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I... And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you. Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything. Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement. No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village. It's not a village. There's nothing there. I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year... ... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability. Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ... Uh, <u>look</u>.... Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch... What is it? Look again! It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world. My son! Do you really think, Ma.... Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance. Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you? He had no reason to. Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one? I can't speak for him. You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks... Oh, so now you think you know me? I'm gettin' there I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year? You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year. Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May. Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic. Oh, it sure would be I think you'd better go. Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and  Are you going to keep him, sir? We better, Congress invented him. It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago. Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle. There was a third man - he didn't give evidence. You don't mean that doctor? No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue. You know I trust you, Claude. Yes, sir. I'll be right back. Sssshhh. She's resting. Where the fuck did you come from? Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator. Do you love me? Uh-huh. What kind of place is this? I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some... I want to see my mother immediately. We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced. I don't think you understand.    I won't wait. What? The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious -- Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast. Sorry about last night - I thought I told you to move that truck! Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke? You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job. Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. Not here. All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly. Jason.. We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right? JASON... You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay? You slept with her! You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no... You put everything on the line because you... You slept with the fucker!! Glass, what is it? I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register. You okay? How do I look? Aces. ...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead. Meurice-- You don't look too good. You sleep last night? This is <u>my</u> town. You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen. Well, you were pretty great! Is it really your camper? Will you defy your father and your Queen? The Queen has consented? She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief. I will do my duty, my lord. Isn't Skye amazing? She's got great tits. She's a constant surprise. And you've only just met. Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice? Absolutely.  And she's got great tits. Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her. The camera loves her.  A great actress. With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them. Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all. I have so got brains. Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See? Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all. Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know. That's easy for you to say - you're already dead. No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead. Why are you doing this to me? Oh! Now do you believe me! Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money. What d'you know about women, Pop? Well, I got married to one of them. Hell, I didn't know you was married. Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl. Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her? Another cup of coffee? No, thanks, I'm nervous enough. I guess it's time to hit the road. Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral. OH JESUS! HELLLPPP! There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now. You're what? I am better. Can't do it.  I cannot do it. External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in -- No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator. Youthful high spirits. Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state. Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving. Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it. Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself? Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut. Oh, yeah...? Ma, you sick? Ya say we're acrost? Look, Ma! Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. Didn' you get no sleep? No. Was Granma bad? Granma's dead. When? Since before they stopped us las' night. An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look? I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped. Do you ever think about starting over? All the time. Can you tell me about it? Cell phone. Shit! Boomerang. Y'what? I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years. This ain't your lot? You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth. Tor, I should be getting home. Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug. Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away. Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside? The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more- Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes... Keep Talking.... What guards Us Against Canada...? Up here, Docky Ocky! No, no!  Not there! Where are my men? Dead. And if I didn't want to come? I guess I'd ask you why. Because I don't think I'm crazy. You're not crazy. How... was she "called? Pardon? Aunt Edith. How did she... die? I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are... Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you. What is this, your farewell speech? I'm going home. Your farewell to the troops? I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin. Have a good trip. And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all. You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back. Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me? No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed. Promise me you will never leave me. I cannot promise you that. Promise me. I will never forgive you. I don't care, but promise you will never leave me. I don't understand you. Promise. Promises mean nothing. Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway. All right -- I promise. You are my old friend. So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump. Gump, is it? Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance. I'm in no mood for dancing. Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing? Faerie ring? To be sure. Wait for Kumar. Come on, Kumar. I don't believe that. Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible! Why did you leave me? I didn't leave you. Your breakfast, monsieur. I don't feel like any breakfast. I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you. No problem. I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad. I don't think I have to now. You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face. And Church will be fine. Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you? Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone. Well done, Commander. You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order. It didn't go off. Oh, God... It didn't go off. Boiler, we're alive. My heart. It just disappeared.  Literally. I'm sure this sounds crazy to you. My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories. Sounds like a special guy. My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave. Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel. Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter? Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped. It's the freest land on earth. Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom. Well, we must be who we must be... He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red. He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake. I'm not sure I know it. We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie? Who's Principal Collins? The principal. Wow. Mmm. You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...? Yes.  I hear you. You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it. Mmm. Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something. And I'm in control of it. But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there. Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town? Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers- Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right? Gave all that up.  Going into business. Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you... [And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.] [I should start going for your tits first.] What time is it? Later. Go back to sleep. Where you going? I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt. Now?!  It's after eleven. I can't sleep. Again? Maybe you should see a doctor. I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too! What about Carter? Tight. But I'm working on him. Lean on him. Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly. Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight! What'd you say to me! Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here. Kelly... Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you... Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning. <u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on-- --no, I think they're all in there. No, thanks. We're not hungry. Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry. No. Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . . And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu. Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it. Conan went to Harvard. How're your hands? Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing. You know, that night, I ... It just all came up. Yeah, I know.  Me, too. I mean, you can play.  You're okay. I can keep the beat. Now, just a minute you can't  Shut up! What are you people going to do? You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move. What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you? You mean a safecracker? Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali. Who's that? I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird. Mr. Gale! Howdy, Miss Gulch. I want to see you and your wife right away.... Murdered...man?... When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess. Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side. Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing. Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh? I promise, Jack... Promise me again... I promise. Come to bed, honey. Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure. Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren -- -- Your employer? -- Mr. Lindgren. Who's Mr. Lindgren? My employer. What line is he in. Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding. I see. Based in London, but with international concerns. I bet. Various enterprises, style of thing. I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life. Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly. Right. Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you. In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren? This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means. -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him. Hi, Jon. Hello, Adrian. lo, Cecil. See-cil. See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers. Thank you. Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform. So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh? Baby, don't do this. I do love you. Obviously there were others, weren't there? Please put your clothes on, please -- YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT. Honey. GET OUT. Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble. Yeah -- me. Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him ! Yahoo !!!!! Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!! No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself! The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave. I do apologize.    A student had a crisis. Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree. That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money. And God love you for it. Is Frank D'Angelo around? At the bar - Sidney... This is going right up your ass. Come on. Be careful! Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you? No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately. I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me. What are you staring at? Who's staring? You look silly. You look great. Has Threepio turned up yet? Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out. Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless? Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes. But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside. They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel. Captain=8A I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final. Accidental? Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there. I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I? Yes. I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy. That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it? Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you? Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting. I'm fine. You're injured. It's nothing. Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out. I'm not married. Oh. This is the top. Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach. That's the best idea I've heard in a long time. Logan, do you see this ring? I've seen a lot of rings. Yeah, I'll bet you have. I still think he's responsible for the smear. Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives! I guess you're right, but - She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now. No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words. According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase. Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit. Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess. What about relatives? All back East. The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper. He drank it hot? Yeah. Good god. Yeah. Keep 'em coming. Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast. Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one. Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon? No. The last one, please. Afternoon! Am I late? No, not if you've got better things to do. Who put a bee up your butt? Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight? Why? Because I got some plans - I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza - And you'll be in all evening? Yes, Joe. Good!  Then you won't be needing your car. My car?  Why, you - Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you! Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again? Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me. Well, good night, then... You going to sleep here, all by yourself? Yes... Oh God. . . Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you? ... it connects you to me... No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise... I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me. We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us. Uh-huh. We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there. And his wife? She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is. Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home? His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C. Oh, my. And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large. Boy, this thing is really... geez. Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know... Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding. What's his story? His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else. Red flag, man. If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space. All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside. Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales. I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home... Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones. Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist? I've got to get back. Tanner. Do you love me? Do you love me? I asked first. Sometimes I think I do. And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then! Come on, that wouldn't make me gay. I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant. What's he like? Hello, guys. Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us. Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him. Oh. You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health. So, Buzz was stooling for you guys. You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car. Hovering? I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it. I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep. You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me. It's like a secret society. That's one way of looking at it. Cool. What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him. How do you do? What is it? Spock's burial robe. Your treat. Yes. My treat. What are you doing? He has no heartbeat! You're hurting him!! I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once. ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!! LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD! You come up here often? I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there? Yeah. Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home. I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer. This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing. Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are. I'm having a very good time, too. So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am. You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago. I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way. Yeah, it'll satisfy me. Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy? I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame! A vote is before the group. Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts. Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand. And what do I get? You get not to go to jail. You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof. Proof?  We've got plenty of proof. ...in. I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but... I don't recall inviting you. I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work! My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow. Pretty advanced, isn't it? Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip. You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard. I thought I might do a bit of business on the way. You're wasting your time. Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert... There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER. Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian. Same thing, isn't it? No, it is NOT. Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many -- What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too. Yes, I know. First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that? What? Assassinate somebody? No -- Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now. Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach. Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water. Somehow I feel safer in here. I'll tell you what... Yes? The poor thing.... And she died... You equipped for random questions? Why, yes, of course. You start. The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me? How do I stop one? Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run, Okay, but... I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement. We might as well start a fire. Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it. I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time. I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog. They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building. Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there. Have you ever been inside? Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is. And what's that? Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse. One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over... Karma. What do you expect me to do?  What in the world - Charles. If they are, they're screening their calls. Range 3000 meters and closing. Ohhh Mother! Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it. This letter was addressed to Superman care of me. Superman gets mail here? Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood. Modred has treated with the Dark Ones. She's not on the starboard side either. We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all. The one on the other side is letting men in. Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on. Before you are. How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now. You don't trust me. Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character. He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed. Yes? You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you. Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice. Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you.. The book says they're probably very good problem solvers. What book! They'll find a way in. What the fuck are you talking about? That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops. Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches! Early! Stop!! I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us. I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury. Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad? It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with. Which one is it? It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs. Otis!!!! Otis!!!! Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs. It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done. Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate. Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted. Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier. Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties. Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect! What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here. Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this. Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come! Otis! I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way. Love? You walked out on a five year marriage. That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time. It's not like this all the time. DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying. And how hard it hit? Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this. You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you. Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second... You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do. That is not true. It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone. Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy. Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her? Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine. Something you obviously have a hard time doing! Hold that thought. Shit, sorry man. Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls! You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? -- what-what-what, ma'am -- I -- I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE -- I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again. That's not enough. I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious. He saw my face too. So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have. They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her. Convenient, isn't it? Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last. I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon. I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month. You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it. Shall we move closer to the fire? Yes -- an excellent idea. -- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry. Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum. Will you get off my back for once? It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training. Look, I told you I'm not going to college. Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to. Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying. I'm so glad you could come, Mr.-- --I'm Woodward. Lay off, Sefton. With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now? Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you. Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand. Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man. Yeah. Sure. How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in. I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess... You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished. It's not that I don't appreciate the offer... Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask? No. Okay. I'll think about it. We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns. We need money first... Yeah... Bobby you gotta... So...? The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense. Her mind is set.  She won't change now. She trusts you, John. I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what? I like "godsend. I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you. I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone. You mean -- you really want to draw me? Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head. But why? Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him. And it's just my head you want? Nothing else? What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder. You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right? I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that. Don't you have a girlfriend? Sometimes. Flynn! Uh, no ... I mean, not that often - Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me. You warm my heart. I don't know!  Nothing! If you died right now, how would you feel about your life? I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?! There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie. Yeah. Where the hell is my car? Hey, Chief, what are you doing here? I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?! The vortex is collapsing, sir. Contact Starfleet Command. My parents? What do you mean? I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty. You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot. Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents. Why did you follow me yesterday? Excuse me? After the market, you followed me to the hotel. I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to. You felt obliged to. As the wife of one of our party. So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it? You were very different yesterday. Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday. Can't it wait? No -- it has to be done by tomorrow. What is? All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely. I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange? On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here. I'm so glad. I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why? Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it. I wonder. I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley. Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker. Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard. See?  Nothing. Nothing at all? Complete washout. That makes me feel just awful. Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside. You mean you can't fall in love? Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant? What happened? I don't want to bore you. Oh, you couldn't possibly. Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me - Oh, no! Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late. Talk about sad. Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine. You poor, poor boy. Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries? How can you think about food at a time like this? What else is there for me? Is it that hopeless? My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money! Have you ever tried American girls? Why? Having two pints in the Rock. Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita. Who's Dil? My special friend. Oh, yeah. We got simple tastes, you and me. The best. But you fellas never get a break, do you? Do you? Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you? We don't look on it like that. I've often wondered how you do it. Depends on what you believe in. What do you believe in? That you guys shouldn't be here. It's as simple as that? Yes. Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work. Then foreclose! I can't do that. These families have children. Get back!! The generator! Screw the generator!! harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction -- Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ? It doesn't say -- Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay. Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . . Have they ever been busted? No. How bad? Mortal. No. Yeah. Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things. Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix... Sounds like a good Idea. I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent. Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L. What about the sender? Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check. I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's... You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp! Just plain 'Joe'? Love that name. Pretty, ain't they? I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile. Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot. When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly? Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes. Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no! We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike? We don't know. West is dead. Four men. Babylon soldiers. Can you walk? Sorry about your father. Yeah. Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything? They said he was drunk. ... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow... How's Mom? So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important. Oh, gosh no. I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you? Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec? You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you. Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right? Right. So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job? Okay, Price. You stay. This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request. Yes, I understand I'm listening. You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it. Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation. Yes, sir. You watch your mouth. Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool. What did you tell him about the baby? That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me. And you turned him down?? Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles. Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom? Never where you expect it, that's all I know. Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain. Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid. I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not... Lovely sound- they seem happy. Don't they, though? So work must be going well? Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you! What's cookin', Bert? I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for... You first. Why don't you get off his case? July of '71. About the past year. You could leave, Paul. What are you saying, Tatsi? Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please. Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then. I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl. I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks. You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty. Mary -- Jabez -- Coming, Ma. We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl. We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you. How? I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle. How heroic of you... Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan. But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it. There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if.. I'm not afraid. Are you? The Queen wishes to publish an account of him. Dear oh dear. We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary? Yes. Quite.  I think I'd best take it back. Of course. For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals. You're doing this to liberate the Remans? No race should be a slave to another. It goes away ... It'll go away. I don't want it to go away. That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh. Uh-huh. That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially-- Hey, is this him with Nancy? That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when-- Lebowski on the right? Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when-- He's handicapped, huh? Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California. Far out. And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity. Nancy's pretty good. Wonderful woman.  We were very-- Are these. These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak-- Different mothers, huh? No, they-- I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool-- They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the-- I see. --without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college. Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more? One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college? Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings-- Heh-heh-- --smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC-- Yes, heh-- --and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me! Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time. Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately. I guess I do too. You what? I sometimes fade out. Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them. You were going to get my door. He's on the ph... Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in... Wat... I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...! Where is he? I don't know. You find something objectionable to working in partnership with.... Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous... You were given backup.... THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint... I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that. And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but... No, I don't get you... Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't... Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint... I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement... Okay, boys, let's have it. Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first... Mickey, can I talk to you alone? No. This is crazy. You can't escape like this. Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try. We'll all be killed. An evil vet? No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something. An evil petting zoo? You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil. You know where they are? Sure. How far? About ten kilometers. Sixty Lira? Sixty? ...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus. No again? I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines. Really? I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune. He agreed? He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage. What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it? Just a minute... Isn't she lovely? Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby. She walks in beauty... We love you, Baby. We all love Janet...Who do we love? Yeah. You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet. Great line. What if Shari's the dream? Ed, do you want my advice? Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved -- Leave her be. You said a woman likes to be pursued. Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth. Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission... I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone? You have to dial nine first. No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky. Good. Is Miss Simone coming today? She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission. What if it catches on fire? Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy. For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO... Peugot convertible ... What color? Gray. Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him. Between... Anything new develop? Unfortunately, no. Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here. Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders... Don't worry, we've got everything. Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island... I know, I know. One thing at a time. Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets. Tickets for what? This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem. I don't want to see that. Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts -- Yeah. Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it. After dinner I'll show you my puppets. Let's get him over to the bed. Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble. Ow?... It'l be alright. It will. It doesn't hurt. No? I don't drink coffee. You must be tired. It'll wake you up. No, thank you. The gunfire did that. She always said that if you were on the outside... But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here. I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you. Take care of me? You know, go to the tonk or whatever. I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood. Want me to come back some other time? Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations. DEATH!! I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go? Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now. Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold! How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher? I come not with Peace but with a Sword. You, Preacher? Poor darling, and then? Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost. There's no hatch.  There's no hatch! Wait... Jason, Here!... It is, Billy. Then we got'em! So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again. I can't. What? Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ... Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right? Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me. You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment. Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I? No, of course not. Just say it, that's all. Hey!  You there! You want something, old man? Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy? You want something? Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop. You can't do that yourself? Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that? I'm sorry, I didn't-- What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself? I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes. I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see? Christ no! Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me. I said I was sorry. Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst. Yeah, sure.  You got change? Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change? All right, old man.  Christ. The Good Witch... Sailor... Lula loves you. But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance. She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor. But I'm wild at heart. If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love. I don't know what the hell to say.... You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel.... Is someone there? Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't. In the Navy, we used to call guys -- Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut. Anybody see anything? ... Let's take a look over there. I've even printed my own currency. Emperor Miguelito...? The first. Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you? Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire! So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer? Good. Let's find a telephone. Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too. They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced. I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler? The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one. If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night. Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore. H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'? So-so, Johnny. Don't hit me, now, don't hit me! What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea. I'm wounded.  Oh, oh. Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow. Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight? I'm going to get laid. Where'd you find such creeps? They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it? I can't swim. I gathered that. I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon. That's okay. Live a little, learn a little. Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there. Alone? How big can it be? Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know. Run down and get some smelling salts, will you? It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La. Who and what is Shangri-La? You? Goodness, no! So there are others? Oh, yes. Who, for instance? In time you will meet them all. Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families. I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there. What do you think? I think you're here all day. You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you? If I say yes, will you take your hand away? No. ...  yes. I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past. There's so much, and so much of it is dull... Were we always explorers? No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life... Looking up at the stars. Yes. And you dreamed about what was up there. About... New worlds. You know, these fit... perfectly. They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace. Did you hear that? What? Did you hear what he said? What? He made, you know, a remark. Honey, are you okay? -- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood. Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar. I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me. It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics. Better go.  Grierson hates people being late. Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ... How you doing, Cato? Not bad. Stay away from me, Wendy! Stay away...! Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in. Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa? Yeah. Okay, then dance. Show. Hi, Elena! Hi. Why are you running? No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!! Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party. Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet. Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ... Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast. The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I m a talking head. And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know. The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed. ...Aren't you skating? Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro. And you never got the chance? Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do? I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place. What are you doing? Now they only have three rockets left. Then, this is what it would sound like underwater? Yes, sir. Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us. Right. And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal. You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime. I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all. I have to go, Sam. I can come down next week. No. Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public? We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three! And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall? Sam! No! All right. Are you coming over tonight? Same time, same place. Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns? Sure. Can we watch the monster movies? Sure. Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn? Sure. Sure. You think I killed my MOTHER don't you? Did you? It's good nobody is following us ... It's a question of habit ... Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us. Can't remember?... What do you mean? He's blanked out on that one particular point. All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me. Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right. What kind of story are they going to believe? Nice doggie. Good boy. Walk away, Jack. Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away. Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again! Oh -- does it hurt you? Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again. Ohhh -- My, it's good to be.... For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later. Yes sir. Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year. I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though. How you doing, man? Not bad, not bad. I've got some pictures.  Want to see? No thanks. Ah, come on. I don't want to see any goddamn pictures. Oh yes, I think so. Look out, Samuel, here it comes. And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here! Carter...you ready to have some fun!? What are you looking for? A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces... Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions. What about? It's about the burglary. Burglary? Downstairs. Of course. Can we come in? How are you feeling today? I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you? I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis? I feel much better. Thank you. Are you comfortable here? Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful. Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins. Nepal? Have you been? Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place. You own a home there? Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu. Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops? Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway. How. Did you. Know that? You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you. Muncie. Whatever. That's what sells newspapers. I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk. Watch it, Archer -- It's about a dimwitted editor who -- You're telling me to dance. No, I'm saying to be -- 35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers. Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing. Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math. Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers. Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ? I don't want everyone to see. Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? How come that's all you talk about anymore ? It's all I think about anymore. You look awful. Thank you. Give up, Mark, it's hopeless. I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway. No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch. Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price. Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go? Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is? I'll kill you for that! Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know? December seventh, forty-one. What time? Six o'clock. I was having dinner. Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys? Who are you ? I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry. I don't scare that easily. Bye, Joel. I love you. Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass. You don't say. I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell. Fucking A, my friend. The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht. Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience. Uh, Jim? Hmm? Walt needs to see you. Oh.  Okay. In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty. Take the 405 south. You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it. You mean we're moving in? You give me ulcers. That's my job. I'll take this instead. Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it... Groom-  - may I have a wedding present? What would you like? Texas? I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go. Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice. Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat. Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy. Not so rough, honey. Good night. Good night? The party's over. What's the matter? Did I do something wrong? It's an emergency -- see you some other time. Terry...? Terry... Terry... . You know me, always taking on too much. Good boy.  Call us if you need anything. Gregor, is that you? Much to your disappointment, no doubt. It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened. I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me! So what do we do? What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do. Joey needs us.  I can feel him. How do we find him, Kristen? So, are you a cheerleader? No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one. Gee, thanks. It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that. They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot. Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete? I can take care of myself. Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way? It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff. Then why are you here? For the same reason you are. Oh, you mean the thrill! The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet. Bullshit. Yeah. You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro. I'm part of the game, just like you. And she's all wrong for me! Well, somet... I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you. A little. Sorry. Thanks. Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you. Still play with dolls, Doctor? She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one? Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes. Hullo, son, how are you? Are you feeling better? I didn't think you could come with the party and everything. Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out! You threw them out! OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!! YOU BASTARD!! Maybe you inspire me. That sounds like horseshit. That's not a question, is it? You're catching on. Still in love? I'm not sure. From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart... ... no, no, no... No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together. Why are you doing this?! I'm doing this for us. Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler. If I leave, you will be right back where I found you... I swear on my life, I won't... You will.  You know you will. It's only a siren... I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day! And they frighten you? You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore. It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you... If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat. He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch. Does that mean we have to cut him loose? Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope. That was nice of Mr. Galbraith. He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him. What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy! Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother? You know I can't. Then fuck it!!! Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest  I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent. But listen, Tom, I  No, it isn't. I'm hungry and and scared. You can't be hungry and scared at the same time. Well, I am. Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing. Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed. Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat. Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing. Boy, are you gonna get it. My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last. We still going? Honda 250, huh? That's right. C'mon, Star.  Climb on. Star?... You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp. Tramp! Beautiful! That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes. Yep. We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge. This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean. This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother. I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle. I didn't know then that I was a nigger. He's bright. They talked about me like Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class. I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible. Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore. How could you possibly know what I've been going through? Yes? Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"? No. I am a "tubab. What do you mean? Tubab means white man. Do you know where you're going ? Yes. Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls. Please, can I have one to surge with? No. Ah, go on, you swine. No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting. What's the matter? This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...? Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow! That's a great idea. This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski! But I'll never win that. Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York. Really? New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage! Thank you. Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading. Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir... Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best. No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses? Trust me, you're the best. But, sir... Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public? You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me-- Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal. I see. Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel? This might take some time. I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while. ...parents. Yes. Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday. There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See? Throws what? How could he have a time bomb? Just pulled the old match gag, see! What's the match gag? Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see? I still don't speak Spanish, Michael. It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot; Yes, Mr. Poe? So? It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier. It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down. Can we get him to the hospital? Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry. There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here. If there's a way in, there must be a way out. No, that's not true---there's well...no-- What I called you...  Why, what did I call you? I don't remember. Oh -- you mean... worm? No, that wasn't it... Was it -- swine? No... it was a seven letter word. Oh yes! -- UPSTART! That's it... Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here? I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir. Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones. It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir. Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking. I never was more in earnest. I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming. Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong. Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works? The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert. Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper? Albert. You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder? Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it. Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman? A woman. What color hair will she have? Blonde. Tell me some other things about her. She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help. You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now? She is preparing a great abundance of food. Why do I always have to sit in back? It's just the way things are, kiddo. Well, I would like to sit in front today. It's not gonna happen. Please. Just one minute of your time. Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you! I've got some things to tell you. Sergeant Major! Sir! Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men. Atten-hut! Go in and ask him to hurry. Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland. I might make him nervous. You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand. That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers. J. S. Bach. Jim West. Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer. I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something? Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal. Funny.  So am I. Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark. Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime. Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk... Where are you going?! To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion. Hey. How's it going? Boss and I are up to about three words an hour. Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come. I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here. Thank you. May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fianc e? I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when. Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley? I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends. Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse. It is a little coarse, yes. Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San -- I have! You have, yes. No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni. Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto. Absolutely. I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then? Tomorrow. Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever. And cunning. And what do you do about it? Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time. Pity. Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back. Yes. See you. Of course. But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you -- Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child. How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...? With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday. Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family. Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care. Is he all right? Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now... Oh my God... Jabez -- will you join our Grange now? Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could. We'll be mighty glad to have you with us. You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy -- Of course I knew. I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me. Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ? She was? As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames. Oh, yes, a religion of sorts. It would seem so, Master. Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there. Makes two of us. I brought you a special present. What is it? Open it up. It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship. What programs were accessed? That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material. Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready. There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs. What's wrong? We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide. I'm gonna go ask him. Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain. Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds. Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames! Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier? Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too! Then why don't you change jobs? Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me! No... Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. But don't you like anything about what you do? With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called. He did? When? While you were in the shower. Why didn't you call me? He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case. What? What do you mean? He said you didn't have one. What's he talking about? I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said. I don't believe this. Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something. What'll happen to us, Nell? Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please. I wouldn't do that. Do what? I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor? Attic space. Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room. My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault? If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law. What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...? Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence... Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my... He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime... Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your... A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero... -- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...? You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime. Underbelly! In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse. I didn't think you'd know I went missing. You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?! A blueprint spool. Where have you been for a week?! Four days.  I left to think. What did you do with your dog? Kurt's been feeding him. But you can't call me while you think? I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think. Exactly. Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out. [Beat] We will. How old you? 17. What? What? What now? Quietly, slow down, whoa -- You can't just come in here. The door was open, I got a call -- You're just come in -- Calm down. I am calm. I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance -- There's no disturbance. I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on -- There's no disturbance. Then you've got nothin' to worry about. You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't -- Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down. I AM CALM. You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here? I don't have to answer your questions. No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here? What does it look like? No one else in here? You're here. OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house? No.  I said that. Are you lyin' to me? I live alone. Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now? No I Said. Ok. What's your name? Marcie. Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me? I preffer to stand. I'm not askin', Marcie. Johnny?  Did you see Ben? Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world. Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"? At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project. He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens. He's got it. And your coat. Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway. Krandog aranty. Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already. Good night, Daddy. Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to -- Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ... I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck. Treat to be here. Don't ask. I wasn't gonna -- Did, uh... Did you kill him? I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way. I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation. There seems to be no secret about that. Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris? It's not particularly my beloved Paris. Have we in some way made you angry, Master? You know better than that. We don't know of anything, Master... Then why do you shake so? It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us. Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you. Aaaahhhh. Nothing's going to happen to you. Nothing? Nothing you don't want. We came here to deliver some clean laundry. It's all right. I really do know them. How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back? Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A! I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean -- Naw.  Uh-huh. Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants? No. No! Never one. Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'! One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun. Six or eight.  And they go wild? They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths. Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too. I think I need my glasses. You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean? I don't fool around with you. You live like a pig. Yeah.  How long have you been here? All night. Well... who are those guys? What do they look like?... Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something? Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something. Well, what? Godammit, George... Now wait a minute... Sit down. But... I said sit down! Anything else you -- Not from you. Well good n- Good night. So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street. Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself. It pains that they should do this. I know it pains. I wouldn't say that. Then what are you stopping for? Yeah, come on, play it. Oh, no, man. I can't. May I speak freely? You show no inclination to speak otherwise! I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"... A woman? <u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>? Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead. And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia? You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit. Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit. C'mon! You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect. I don't think that's a good idea. I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here? What's going on, my friend? You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what? He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you. Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of. It's mutating... spreading like a disease. It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend? Bright enough to be dangerous. That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe. Yeah, but he was in silhouette. How about in the house? They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this. Did you see his hair color? No, Why? And what are you thinking we should do now? I've filed a report with Father Frank. A lot of good that'll do. We need all the help we can get. I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us. We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then. Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way. How can it be bullshit to state a preference? Since when did this shop become a fascist regime? Since you brought that bullshit tape in. Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it. We'll do it next Monday. Well what's the point in that? Slick as snot and I'm not lying. Fifteen lousy bucks. A man who plans ahead. It's Mr Brown, ma'am. What is he doing there? He appears to be ... standing by his horse. I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there? I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe. Are you sure? Totally! Look! I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse! Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay. Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Come on, old Pete. Come on! Come on, old Pete. God, man! I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'. Oh... ...easy, easy, easy. Left, left, left! Get over!  Get over! Come on. Oh, shit.  Come on, old... ...Pete!  Come on. Come on, old Pete.  Oh. I know the likeli-... ...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim... ...Night Shift, but you might... ...wanna give it a try! Come on, old... ...Pete.  Come on.  Come on. Come on. Come on... ...you crazy bastard. All right, you got it, you got it! I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look? Good. Thanks. So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop. Let's see your bread. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession. What sins have you to confess? Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc , and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident. Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta? I... a... slept with my fianc 's brother. That's a pretty big sin. I know. You should think about this. I know. Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life. Alright. I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. What do you think? Viridian? Viridian?  What is...? How you feelin' today? You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more. I know that. Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song. Go'on and sing it, I'll play. No, you do it. I can't sing. Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love. What I love. Get a good picture in your mind. You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place. But it's not true. What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing. You've got everything? Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact. You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that. I wish you were coming with me. And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger? Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers... Where you been all day? I took the kids to my sister's. I called. You weren't there. I got bored so I went to the movies. What'd you see? I went to the movies. What'd you see? Father of the Bride. What was it about? Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything? Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away? What're you talking about? Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night? I am answering... What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here. Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts. Goodbye, Sandra. Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you. Thanks, Unc. Rise...and...shine...! You re jumping, sweetheart... Patrick? Is that you? No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken. This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag? Commes des Garcon. What the hell was that, another statement? Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck. You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing... Door to the right. Get up and run. I can't see a thing. Neither can they. You can't believe how much he's improved. How many times have you shocked him tonight? Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours. What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator? That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it? A medical miracle. Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner? Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose. No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place. What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him? No, I'm not. I'm looking at you. Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him? I'm not interested in him. You're not interested in him? No, I'm not. In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right? Jake, c'mon now. Don't start. Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him? Where'd you hear that name? I just heard. Who is he? I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business? I have nothing more to say. ...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth. What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it? I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing. Walter -- Don't call me that. Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear. Wrong answers? There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you. Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day. The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here. OK. The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it. I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front... Available cash is not an issue for us... Twenty-eight-point-five. What if I pushed to twenty-one...? I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal... Maybe I'm only one. I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can. That depends on the man. If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped. I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan. Well, the world is a little bit colder today. What? Flashlight. Don' be facety, woman. None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news. No, I come to see Doctor. Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you? Nuthin'. You know Chastity? I believe we share an art instructor Get lost, Ginger! Get lost! Get lost? Yes. Get lost? Yes. Kiki? It's all right. I'm not hurt. You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy. No.  Not yet. Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy! No they're not. You're rude. I mean, you're very rude. Hey, I tried to get her off the phone. You know what I'm talking about. No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something. Like what? I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times. Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny? It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny. Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra... I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. ...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light. Seventeen. Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella? Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head. Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. What's the word on the chairs? I'm working on it. Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge. Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now. They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome! Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think? You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time. But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company. I will - good night Mrs. Swicker! What's the matter with you! But it hasn't been forever. It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know. Yeah, but we-we made so many plans. Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else. Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay? Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name? Your last name. Yeah, what is it? It's... I don't know. No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me? Got another gun and a stun gun... And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him. What do you do when he comes home? Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County. You do that? That's my job. Did you do it that night? He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it. And is that it? More or less. Your Majesty There was a wager, I remember as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play? ...I can't remember. That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means? It means we're probably to tired to remember. It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by. Do you still...see each other? Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight. Hello. Hi, it's me... Fuck you. You know what I think? What? That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today. But it would hurt. Well, that's the point, stupid. Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you? Oh, god... We were good when you bailed, weren't we? Very good... Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process. No way ... No ... ? No ... They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam? Yeah, boss? Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York? Uh, my watch stopped. I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America. Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh? Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly! No more man. I'm about to drop as it is. See ya. Where you going? Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you. Flame on, asshole. And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned. ...I know...I know... ...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows... No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene. What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner. Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen? Sixteen. Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you? Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional. So you think the dissertation will get published? I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny. Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most? I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much. There must be something... Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out. There is no one here but the dead. Go away!  I don't want you here. If that were true, I would not be here. It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants. From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child... Why should I? What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out. I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked. That's enough. I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it. Is it going well? Very well. But nothing is happening. Yes, but very well. What are you doing? Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you? You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think? Thank you. When Debby... Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you? Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course... Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman. That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open. I hate scary movies. It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand. If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie. We got free tickets. Well done, Commander. You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order. Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with- It doesn't have eyes. The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots. It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots! They don't arrest people for having feelings. If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them? He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming? He's floating.  Take it home. Hector. Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire   I love that, I believe that.  Who is K? K is for Katharine. I'd better get you to a hospital. I'll be okay, just get me home. What happened?  You got fired, huh? Yeah, Morgan. I got fired. How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom? Can you fix him for me? Yeah. Sixpence. Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up? Starting tonight? You ain't goin'... He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in. Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you. So tonight's the night. Are you two excited? I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year. Nancy, don't fall asleep in there. I won't. Get into bed. I will. Sup then? Sup? Come on bitch. Throw your fists up. Elaine. Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself. And you are?... Kate. You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate? No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later. This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here. What are you doing? I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak? Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history. You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked. I'm getting rid of the fucking animals. What? I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me. No they're not. You've always hated the animals. You've always loved the animals. I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus. What's that? Us, of course. Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative. What was? The stuff we got last night. Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative. No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative. What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative? Don't get funny with me again. I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out. Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back. Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow. Let's ditch this place and party. Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow. Why? Why not? Where are you goin'? We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by. Thanks, but... we've got plans. Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting. I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity? Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot. You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions. You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all. Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets. Murderers? A woman... Murderers like you? A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on. Delusions of grandeur. You should be thanking me. And, why is that? You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be. We would have gotten you eventually. Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in? D'you think we should do something? Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son? After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches? I thought you'd given up on my picture. I'd like to try again.  If you're game. Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait. Could you grow cinnamon? I don't know. Sure, I guess. You could make your own cinnamon toast. I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that? I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria. What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party. That is correct. And you say he doesn't remember any of it? Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition? Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out. I saw Gregoire make a call, sir? When? As the trucks go. Do I know you from somewhere? You may have known my father, William Starks.  INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN. Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag. No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM! That does sound lucky. It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling. Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic. Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it. Well, thanks. How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on. Shut up. You think you're so...but you're just... That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it. Are you all right? I'm fine. Are you sure? How's your knee? I'm fine all over. Mind if I come in? Of course not. No, sir. Excuse me. What did you say? And you're not really as large and useless as you seem. I'm better than that. Don't push it. I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow. It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody? This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it. Praxis? What's left of it. Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall? Rekall? They sell fake memories. Oh, Rekall. Yeah. RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there? The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished. Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg. Would that make you any happier? Much happier. All right. You know you're welcome any time! Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out. It's fine by me, Jesse. Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you? I don't know. He translated it wrong. What? And the second condition? Time is of the essence. Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL! It's a pleasure... Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success! This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is. He told us it's in the Buick. We don't know which Buick, do we? Well, why'd you shoot him? I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do. It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor? What? Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos. That woulda been cool. Exactly, cheesehead, exactly. ... and Rigel. And that one -- to the right of Rigel? Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood. You might be right. Why are you smiling so? No, sir. Right. The mothballs, Mister. It's the truth, I swear. All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face? I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you? Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials. Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong. Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person. Can I take you someplace to hear something nice? Eh, Mickey, it's getting late. Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me. I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them. Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint. That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful. I'll help you...! I won't. I can't allow that, Sonny... You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand? Kill them both. Here? Do it! I got somebody you could run over, Mother! Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident. What do we have here, Margaret? It's a tampon in a teacup... Trying. Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us? Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside. George, I don't -- You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside. You told them that? It's true, isn't it? What the fuck's that got to do with it? They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in. What did they say? That makes you uncomfortable? A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession. Is it? Yes -- it is. Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about-- --the Calan.  Do you know who they are? Why don't you tell me. He's here. You should pay as fast as you collect, you know. How'd you do out there, Jimmy? Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished. It'll never be finished. Huh? That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again. I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep. Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52. Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time. Please, Ed. But it's... Please, Ed. We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence. We're losing it. ...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl. Tammy Curry? Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win. This pageant's like a roach motel. Girls check in, but they don't check out. Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health. Yeah. Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan. I'm getting to believe you. This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so. She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is... I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted? The Sistine Chapel? Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world... Fine, Chief. Gimme the keys. NO, but I will lock you in. What? We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral. Let's try a little harder, shall we? Will you give me a break? That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed. Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex. Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named.... Velma. Eddie... What's a DD-5? A Complaint Follow-Up form. -- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man. Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name? How do those cockroaches get here so quick? They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well. Sorry about that... I just... Oh, it's alright. Kay, place your bets. What's this? That's a dime, Martini. I wonder. What? Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules. You can tell that from here? I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter. Would four of them -- ? No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible. Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her. Oh my G-d, you've been robbed! No...I've been pregnant. We already know. All about it. It was on the television. Look, Daddy . . . paste it. Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together. That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake. Not me.  Us. It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in. Give him the money. What? You heard me.  Count it out. He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in. He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars. Bob, do you remember Mary? Who? Mary. From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas. Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace. Who is this?! How dare you -- Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them. I can't. I thought there was something... That night in the club... Lieutenant... Evan... or Maverick. Maverick...you know the rules of engagement. The what? Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do? What are you talking about? You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe. I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage. Harmless! Uh hum. What if he's not? You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens. Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me? If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right. You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way! He truly doesn't care if he ever works again. Yeah, ain't it swell? What? Maybe you resent how busy I've been. What are you...?  No. You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow. Sabotage? Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or... The accident...? But then you've been so much better... Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not... Sweetheart-- No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you. Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening, Captain. I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together. Yes sir. You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way. What? Nothing.  It's not funny. What?  What's not funny, Thelma! Do I have to do this? Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean. ...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows? How's it goin'? 39. Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket. What are you doing here, where've you been? I have a new client. That crazy guy? Yes. Joe. KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out. Excellent...excellent! We've found it at every event site we've been to lately. You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'? That was for you. I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives. Oh no, I can't do it. You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you? Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement. You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel? At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once. Did you shoot the rapids? No, but I shot some ducks. If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country. Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him. Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you -- You're home. Yeah. I'm coming over. I'll call you back. No you won't. What do you mean? I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding. Okay.  Yeah, yeah -- 'bye. Down I would say... What would you say? Down. Down ribbon! Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude. It's the LeBaron. Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh? Now will you get out? I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection. I know what you mean. At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin. She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them. I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her. How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law. I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me. Bet. The boss is getting hoarse. There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that. Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy. Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do. I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little. Looking good... You should talk... Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them. Martha!  For God's sake! Leave me, now sir, I am tired. Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people. Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books. Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven. Wow... read something. Will you wait until the chump is played? Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets. I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya. All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight. Just as long as I get to finish the play. How do you do? Can't complain. I hate this... Only kidding! I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I? Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! I never signed the form. I did it for you. What! Shit! It's what you wanted isn't it? Yes ... No ... I don't, know. Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this? Nope, there's no way. Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like? Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is. In other words, I'm fucked. In so many words, yes. It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em. There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy... If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island? Jet ski...there's one left up there. Did -- did you -- It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him! I walked. You walked? Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail. Roy? Mm? Look at me. Oh, I am, baby, believe me. Roy? It this all we have? All? It ain't bad. No more than this? Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson? Wilson  yeah   yeah  I fought Wilson. I thought you were going to take him that night but... You want to know something  I would have taken Wilson  I think you could have. If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him  boy, I was ready that night. You sure looked it. Something go wrong? You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. No, I don't mind. I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault. Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea. We haven't got a lead... Why not? They took 'em... I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when -- Anger. Rage. Frustration. Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or... I'm sure I can come up with something. Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you. Thanks, Unc. No, I'll kill you. . Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls.. Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up. Damn if I won't. You are --? ...Yes -- A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone. Where from? Des Moines. What's he do? Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think. How're ya feeling? Fine, I guess... Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind... <i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i> <i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i> How is she? A little slow, but she'll be fine. Have you talked to Triplette? Who the hell is he? He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker. Who the hell is he? He's going to run for president. Third party? He has that sign with the tree. What does he want? Barbara Jean. What! That's what he wants. You know better than that. It's on National television, Barnett. I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change. How did you find out about the toxin? Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him. You're not capable of it. I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember? I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again. Real courage. That's what we want. You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me. Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!  One night with me! You think you're kidding. Call the skank now or I start redecorating. You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack. Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you. I already made an appointment for later today. See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time? I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again? Dr. Homer Wells. I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time. Gotta go with the belt there... I used to go with the wrench. The wrench, why? Cause fuck him, that's why. There we go. Well, that's a relief. That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses. I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs... Hot dogs? I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you. My whole life has been combat. I want it to be over for you. Not possible. I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us. I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops. I know I can bench more than that! Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois. I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark. It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you? No sir. It was fun, anyhow. I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do. Can we play ever' Saturday? If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye. Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose. Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'. How 'bout twenty? Now you talkin'. Bet! Bet you ass... You're a witness, Doc! Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit... Sooner than later.  You really need to. In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation. HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!! What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us. There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money. Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something-- I'm not going. Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless-- Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that. I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl. Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool... You're joking, right? We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing..... Like a suicide thing? Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion. I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own. We'll have to sneak in. No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us. Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out. What are you making: It's going to be a tree, I think. Good day, Mr. Chance. Good day, Sally. Air bubbles!... Doctor -- No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes. Uh, Jack - look, I can explain... Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these. Oh, I couldn't copy your work. But you copy my work every week. Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh? I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table. Charisma? Or something. Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am? What? This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand? Seth, if you were me -- Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes. Yes. Yes, Seth, I understand. Yes, Seth, I understand. I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out! No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry. Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend? I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what? Yes. Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what. I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did. Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup. Why does he want to kill me? You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less? Aye. It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all. But we cannot be killed. There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end. How can I stop such a man? Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help. Why? We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts. Cable from Gainsford. Oh, read it! Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford. How the heck?!... What's going on?! I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean? Yeah, you bet! And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do. So who killed him? The Disco Boys. Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation? Ray -- -- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man. What'd you expect to hear? Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic. What you call myths, we call our history. It's not real. What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths. I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here. You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian. Magda, Puffy barks at everybody. That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you? Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh. We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain. Do you have everything you need from command? What did you wish for, honey? I already got it. Everything I want. You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die. And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up. A dirty frame! Emma! Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies. No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it? I am funny.  I'm real funny. Are you in town?  This sounds long distance. No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas. Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is. Hi. Hello. I brought these, but clearly... We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here. Good idea. I'll be Elvis and you-- Are you sleeping? No. Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over. Great. You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to. Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times? Of course. Why the hell are we wasting time here?! Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us. Randy Stetz? That's right. What the hell took you so long? Did you ever see anybody renew? I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions. Did you? Of course. Anybody we know? Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do. I'm fine...  See you... At Carousel tonight? First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father. Not as long as I'm alive. Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet. What do you mean starvation? It takes money to buy food. Why, haven't you ? Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene. You didn't give that boy all your money? I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now? Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way. Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there? To New York? Yeah. I'm following you. Aren't you afraid of me? No. Okay. Hang on to these. Where are you going, Baxter? Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway -- I'm not through with you yet. Yes, sir. The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man? Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show. How would you like to go tonight? You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City -- I made other plans. You can have both tickets. Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home. Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans. So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else -- I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them. Swap them? For what? When are you coming home? As soon as I can walk. Something wrong with your legs? No -- it's my stomach. Your stomach? They had to pump it out. Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head. Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings. Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for. Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker. Thank you. Would you like the same suite? Definitely. It's fine thanks. Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ? Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting. Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived. Guess I'm just lucky. That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano. I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner. An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all. Hate to disappoint you. I have no right to answer that. What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth? That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it. Depends, who pays? Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number. ... I told you, I'm not hungry. Patience.  It's time to eat. Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now. It's the Jedi's time to eat, too. Will it take long to get there? How far away is he? Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi? Because of my father, I guess. Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already? Bloody well tell me who sent you. You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself. I know who's trying to kill you. Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood. He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand. I would have preferred staying home, me. You're a reluctant traveller, then. Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am. Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun. You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done? You know something about me? Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try. You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water. Water? Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills? WILL! And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille. She's your understudy. Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea... I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago- It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss. You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign? What? He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it. Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this. Joey -- do it. You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position? I just fnished work. I counted the bags. We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated. Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there. Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while. But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me. Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation. Oh yeah. Fine. Thanks a lot, Ted. Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth? What? I have news. The Regent has resigned his post. Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself? Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen. He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams. Can I help you? I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat. Well, what did you want? You have any biscuits for sale? Naw, we don't have biscuits. Make sure you put this back. Aww, can't I keep it? Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please? It's my mother.  Who needs this shit? What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco... ...And I from Phyllis. So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there? I didn't think you smoked bud that much. I don't. I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state. Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure... I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today? Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow? If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today. It'll be ready. You're my man, Pete. Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what? I thought I was in...prison again. Just like that?  You were in prison? No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said. You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods? I don't know -- I don't remember. The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax? It was?  I didn't...know. James, you said he was hiding in the barn... I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy... IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL! He knows. How the fuck could he know? He saw the wire. How's he supposed to see the wire? He knows something's up. You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless... What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must.... Thought you had a skirt earlier. I got others. What do you want? That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again. There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up.. Stop. Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment... Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it. Where were you? I went back to the Myers house... I found the car! He's here! Where? Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block. It's only a siren... I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day! And they frighten you? You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore. It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you... If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat. You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son. I'm sorry to hear that. Cognac? I should be checking on the boat. The war will still be here tomorrow. Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look. They belong to the people. I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People! Do you think it's a possibility? Yes. How can you say that? That wasn't the answer you wanted? Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort? What do you make of it, Margo? It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian. Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you. Do you really love me or are you just saying that? I really love you. As much as Mother Miriam does? As much as God loves you. You didn't walk out here. It's mine all right. Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac. Did you do it? I think so. Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds. I couldn't wait till tomorrow. How the hell did you do that? Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth? I'm supposed to understand this. You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you? No. Then let's go have some fun. Time? Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in! Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right? Yes, sir. What? This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill. Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan. Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor. Just do it. Atta-go. Sir, please lower your voice-- Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in? That is our most modestly priced receptacle. Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once. Really? Don't talk about it much, though. Sorry I didn't get her back in time. No problem.  Do you want to come in? Why not? Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking. So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this? What's it say? Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory. There you are.  Out you come. Oh my God. Could I have a tissue please? Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours. Are you crazy? A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake. Thank you. You're welcome. Who is that? That's the sister. Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga. I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen. Why? Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit. Mama??? You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story. Like hell. You want the Spencer, Bill? Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit. Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings... Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere? Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here? What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal. Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer. Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems... You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away? Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed. Why? Because I have a gun and I say so. Oh yes, oh that's great. I'm very nervous. Why? The last date I had was twenty years ago. That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS! Oh come on. Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry. Are you sure about all this? Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh? Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute. Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track. No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look? Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em. I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place. Stripper? No...no stripping...as the hostess. Hostess? Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight. Chinese food? Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish. Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly. Bye. What is it? Kambucha mushroom tea... Jody-- It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring-- You're discussing me with your psychic? She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit. Thanks, but I'm fine. So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different? That'd be fine. Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time. Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over. Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage. And who was the enemy? SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800. I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion? Yes. Fuck him. Don't. Fuck her too. Come on, Ray. Come forward. No way, Cooch. No!!! Stay away, Sam. Leave the boy.  Take me. Where is she? Moved out. She moved out? Well, that just about figures for today. So...where's my truck? It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five. I did what I could for you... ...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck? I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off? Your line, George! Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear? Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach. Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily! What d'you mean? The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra! I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police... Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you. Where's Scully? I have answers for you. Is she alive? Yes. You almost had me fooled. What? Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case. The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion. Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas. What is the service, sir? There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet. I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong. No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man? You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya. I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy. So could Shaw. Then why the rat? Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him. Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you? Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour. Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door. Oh, thanks, Bobo. You want a drink? Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez. See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly. Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth. Okay. Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there? I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill. Bet you are. At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds. That would give us only three seconds to revive him... What are the problems in stopping the Heart? Nothing -- compared to starting it up again. He's really not a bad fellow. Just dull. Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be. Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor! Doc--! I heard you were looking for this. You're the guy killed Dutton. I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you. Thank you VERY much indeed. Now stop it! It's SO nice to feel wanted. Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there... Trust me to get the missionary. That's alright, we got a pressing engagement! Yeah, right outside the door! Studio B. Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp. The car's no there yet? No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today. You're kidding, right? Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere. Okay. It's okay, Stephen, I -- -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go... Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people. You know she married Baby Suggs' boy. I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was. Aw, no, Ella. Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of. You was friends. Till she showed herself. Ella. I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children. What's any of that got to do with Paul D.? What run him off? Tell me that! I run him off. You? I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day. You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew. He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at. He knew Baby Suggs? Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too. And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought- Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after? Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines. Talk about Segretti-- --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too. There were more then. Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere-- --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation-- --don't you miss the grand scheme too. How grand? Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti. And Justice and FBI know all this? Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief. Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats? I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty... So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'? Okay. I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they? Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile... You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest. Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat. Do you know who I am? You are me. No. My name is Data... I am your brother. He found us even there. He always did. Gotta have kings. Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him. Fuck you. Yeah. I love gifts.  What did you guys get us? Nothing that can't be exchanged. Oh.  Well.  Good. Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book. The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead. Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful. Yes, she is. But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally. It's a novel. Still.  Well.  Let's drop it. Yes. I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron? No. It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize. Yes I did. Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find? Don't I find what? I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long... Not long. Don't be silly. Joking. Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that -- Do I put you off? You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you. And I you. But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid. Ah. And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see? Mmm hmmm. Scuse me? Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir? Fuckin' A. Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry. A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading. Is it getting worse? No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it. You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore. I'll be alright. Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and -- Jack, I -- No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright. I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt. Come look at this. What's that, honey? There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'. It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time. Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast. You promised justice. If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I? People have put their trust in you. They have done nothing of the sort. Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise? That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there. Really? I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business -- -- well, if you're gonna go -- -- I'm probably not gonna go though. -- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something -- -- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it. Joe, give my nephew a drink. Your nephew doesn't want a drink. No. Looks like you'd make a good runner. Well. I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense. How about me?  I don't get a drink John? Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony. Hey, Lowell. How are you, Jim? Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there. I've never seen you in here before. That's because I've never been here before. I'm Sylvia. What's your name? What did he say? I don't know, man. He's a fucking character. Guest? We have opened a restaurant... Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing. I don't think she can sing, either. Take care, pal. It's about the Three Musketeers. Thank you, Miss Boatwright. When you read it we'll talk about it... Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. . Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now... Where's Nguyen now?  What city? Huntington Beach, California. It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts. Nguyen is good boy. Come on, this way! Years of Academy training...wasted!!  Been trying to figure out your secret. My secret? Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less... ...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do. And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think... ...like a fish. No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... ...is a perfect hunter. He's brains without ambition... ...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's... ...the master of his realm. How can we ever hope to win against the trout? There's only one way you can do it, Mason. Turn the power of the hunter against him. Tie a fly... ...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive... ...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite... ...back... ...and that power... ...without caution... ...is death. Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-... ...-to a simple thing like... ...fishin'. Some people might. I was just taking a walk before dinner. You love walks. Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch. Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way. Watch the first step. Surf's up. Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there? You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight. know, but  Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand? But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time? Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking! See he was cheating from the get go. He's been running money for the Mafia. You're nothing but a... a... The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long. Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?... We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves! You don't know if he was really gonna -- Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives. So how are you doing, dad? Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that Yes, I know that. Don't let yourself down. I won't.  Goodbye, dad. I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir. Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before. From here, I must go alone. You will tell me her name and we will go together. You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance. Is this the treatment? Sorry... I'm done. Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach. It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world. It was a beautiful present. Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?! You need a table. She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood. It wasn't like that. Then what? What?! She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it. I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it. I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife. Your place? Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids. Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house  When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house? I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that. You believe in it. Oh, faith's a little more than just believing. How about Bruce's? Walter, you can't do that! Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth. Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation. It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist. Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money. We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right? Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll. You used to love it when I called you doll. You said it differently then. I thought you were out of cigarettes. I found some in my purse; would you like one? No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body. Well she sure isn't normal. You don't mean that. Yeah. I mean that. No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you. The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her. Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents? No. How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed? Compensated...? How were you paid? I was given meals, and a home... I can dig this music... But not that singer. Why? He's right in the groove. He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type. Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize. Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar. Mom... I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again. YOU WON'T GET HURT... Elijah was wrong. How do I know that's her? I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in. Why should she come in? She trusts me.  She'll do what I say. Bullshit!  Prove it. Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door! Have to get these wet things off. You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving! I'm...happy. There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy. What's wrong? I'll never be able to do that. Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ... No, that's not it. Thanks. It must've happened right after we left. Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit. Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh? The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.  And where are you going? After that re-... It's good nobody is following us ... It's a question of habit ... Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge. During wartime the national suicide rate goes down. Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black. War is not all black. I don't need a shrink. Harvey says he's amazing. Norman... What can it hurt to talk to someone? No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact. That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change. Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more. What's the matter? Getting yellow? Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners. Nothing about the porters yet? Porters? Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing. Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we? I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners. Shhh! If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen? Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her. Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man. Real good, Chet... It's been awhile. Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope. No... She's fine. Back home. What'll it be? The regular? Black Label? Set one up. Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push. I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott. You ok? I'm fine. [Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you... Then don't. But... what about Starks? What about Starks? Should we be... Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes. But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that? The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room. Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place... Talk to Nikko...! Yeah. So you have information for me? Is that what your little note says? Yes. Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear. Why give yourself up? I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared. That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that? I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there. I thought you said the eggs weren't... It's fine. Mind your own meal... You should get the order you want. And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty. Does this make it with you? Doesn't seem like our man, does it? You tell me.  I'm new in town. He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of. The fingerprints. Yes.  They were there... so, it must be. We'll tag along. The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore. What?! Please. So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it? I don't know.  How do you? Like, normal style.  The...missionary position. Okay. What? What is it? It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT! I don't love you any more. Just like that? Like turning off a light. There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on. But Scottie, you don't have to! I want to! Come on! Are you going in? No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated. You never know, you might be lucky this time. No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins. What do you want from me? I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it? I didn't say that.  I never said-- Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid. Calm down, calm down. Shh! Shh.  Hide her car in the back! That's probably him now... ...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know. What took you so long? Kill him! He's the one!! Not me, idiot - HIM! Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill? Because I like to torture you. Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook? Don ' t you even dare. . . What steps do we take now? We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine. What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation? It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation. You see that? I saw it. How'd it go? He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first. What are you two up to? Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along? Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker-- --so? I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami. Thank you. Want another one? I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet! Madam, I am here. What is your will? We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it? I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you. A simple yes or no would have done. Want me to lead? Cute. You're in a rush. Mr. Dumbarton is, yes. Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive. You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator. I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks. Shit, he's puking on my feet! Well, you p-puked on his feet. Yeah, but he was wearing shoes! Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him? Ask Monsieur Rick. Do you know what this is, Frances? I ought to know. What is it? Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me? What? I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet. Shhh! A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them.... And now.... They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather.... Is it a poem? No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN. What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel! And as barren of love as stone. I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter. Be fair, Oona. You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart! Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot. Take me. Let the boy go. Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor! What are you talking about? Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today. My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking? The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now. Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last. The ghosts-- You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy? I think the worst is over. It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. What's it smell like? Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate. Like Crazy Glue? Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it! I warned you. Go to hell. Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'? Now, what would I be trying to say? Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look. He asked me to see were you all right. What about Betelgeuse? Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>. It was a very emotional time for Buttercup -- I don't be-leeve this. We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look. Scientific American?  Really? I'm surprised he hasn't left. I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave? Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time. Jim, don't.  You're scaring him. He likes it. I think there are sixteen there. This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are. Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here? Just wanted to see how your doing. I kinda screwed things up. I'm sure you're overreacting. I don't think so. You're always your harshest critic. She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her. Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say. Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes. ...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong. You're kidding me. Right through those doors.  The man himself. Jesus... He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing. Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be... Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling. You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him? Did better'n that. Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems? There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials. Yes. There are only ten. Go. It's closed... closed. We need one that's open. Closed? You'll see. What do you mean grammar? The basic grammatical rules of robbing. Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling? I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced! You want me to keep that under the table for you? If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale. Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung. Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me. You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place. Why do you need to wreck this company? Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind. If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word. It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life. Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough? Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest. How much is enough Gordon? The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you... Obviously... Negative.  Negative. INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. Need any disks? Yeah, I'll take some. Hey! What? This is Alvy Singer! Let's split. Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold. Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug. Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway. So why didn't we? We don't speak Czech! I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris. You seem to feel fine about it. I mean morally. Murray was my friend. Murray's dead. Poet? I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower. Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin! I'm finished. Finished! What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy. I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say. There goes Mother. Yeah. Let's go peep from the living room. Okay. Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother. How was your plane ride? The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away. Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei. Now, hold on. Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern... I don't know how you put up with him. He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy. I'll bet. When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical. And what was that? Maintain liberty, humanity and justice. Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated? I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost. And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag? What telegram? Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party. I have no idea what you're talking about. The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider. I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings. Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President. I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous. It is customary to write first, and request an appointment -- Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy. My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics. I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it. I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either. He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me. My heart! Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep. I no from around here. Yeah, you and everyone else. How long you been waiting? What? How long have you been waiting? Since four. I'm sorry. Detective Morelos. Hey, did you guys find my stuff? Your stuff? The robbery. No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up. Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident. Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report. A report? A police report. That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there. You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before-- I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus. Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something. About what? About the accident. I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused-- Mr. Zavitz was in trouble. What kind of trouble. You tell me. I can't. Are you invoking attorney/client privilege. I'm not his attorney. Than why can't you tell me. Because I don't know. I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident. Than why don't you talk to the bus driver? Why so edgy, Mr. Dean? Somebody took my blender. We'd appreciate your cooperation. I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work. In court. On opposing sides. Are you serious? Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am. I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one! That is very probable.  What's your reasoning? Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>. They went crazy. Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him. Hey... very tense. Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost? Five hundred; six maybe. You're two months behind--you got enough to cover? I think. Give me your checkbook then. It's right under that pile. That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri. The tenth's out. What? I can't make the tenth. What do you mean? I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance. Be reasonable, Jack. I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be? Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you. Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women. It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark. I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife. Where's my information? In here... Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be. Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd. Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal... <u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads... I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill. Bootstrap? Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin. That's not true. I swear, you look just like him. It's not true my father was a pirate. Figured you wouldn't want to hear it. He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules-- You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines. My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden. Sure -- because he could always go pirating. My father -- was not -- a pirate! Can you get me that ring back? No. Tell her to bring it back! There it is, Sal.  Sal? I'm here. Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board. Then why are you teaching me...? Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid. You don't need to sit next to me right now. Who were you talking to? Nobody. Sooze. They did show up.  Isn't that great? I hope so. What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway. That's it? Are you Australian? No. Good. I fucking hate Australians. Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it. Auto-shop? Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence. Evidence of what? Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too. Frederick Frankenstein? Fron kon steen! Are you putting me on? No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen. And do you also say Fro dereck? No, Fred ereck. Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen? It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen. I see. You must be Igor. It's quiet. Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler. Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on. I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie. That's why I'm crying. Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is? You've been up all night? That obvious, huh? Then you saw him, too? Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look... There better be a guy with the You bastard... David. I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest? I'll take you there. Paris - Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!! Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files? He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me! Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff. Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong. Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it? Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine. Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me... I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who. MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone! Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest... Vito Cornelius? What do you mean? I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day. I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED??? My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey? Your pocket? The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge. Right. And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come! We won't! Mind your own business. It is my business. It's my name. But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want. Does that about do it? I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one. Who -- Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped. What? When do I get to Lathrop Wells? Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and... Hello? Lena? Yeah? It's Barry. HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE? Yes. OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing? I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip -- Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me? You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you? No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend? About six months ago. Why? I just wanted to make sure. When was the last time you had a girlfriend? Where you married? yeah. Ok. So you were married for how long? Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff? Ok. Where are you from originally? How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim? No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die. There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened? Maybe. Hey, Sonny - You did it! Let's move it, goddamn it. You have the cutest nose I've  Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me! What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat? It isn't cheap. It's nice. Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now  Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live  Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose. Can I get another one of these? Definitely! That's a great handle. Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire. I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back. Did you call the Zoo? Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased. Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something? The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir. Good God. They suggested oranges. Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying... Is he cool or angry? No charge? Your money's no good here. Where's Mac? Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them. What does this guy want? He'd like to kill me. Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment? Not at all. Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen -- -- you got your microwave -- -- you got your sink -- -- you got your shower -- -- see this, television! Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff. We're safe! No we're not. When do you want it to go off? Seven-thirty tomorrow evening. So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now... Rivers of the stuff! And it's all flowing toward the museum. Come in. Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side. Well, that's all part of it. We've got weather moving in from the west. You re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what s left of him... The acid bath? Huh! You ve been around, eh? Then you'll have to git ! Yeah, you'll have to git . Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep. How deep? Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you. Mkay. God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle. I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once. We got caught. So you know it won't happen again. Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away. Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then. Let's keep her. Waste the dude. We've got to get him out of here. He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him. We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding. How'd ya get him in here in the first place? I don't know. No brag. Just fact. Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ... They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants. Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father? No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out... Over the water department, or over you? Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me? Then it was over the water department. Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke. Oh, yeah? Yes. He never forgave him for it. Never forgave him for what? For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day. You sure shout that? Of course I'm sure. What about you? Do you and your father get along? ...Your room does that too? I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper. What a dump... But what does *that* prove? Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense? So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen. Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night? Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie? Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion. Just a little insurance... against the unexpected. Would that include me? Oh, I would hope not. Harder.  Take the towel off. Jack! Enough! Go ahead. Talk to her, Sidney... Talk to her yourself... Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier? How about something better?   Like a kiss. Now what? We figure out if it's in here. How? Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time. Clever girl. Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through? Yeah.  Some of it was fun. She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early. She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires. That can wait till the weekend. There are important papers from -- It can wait.  Anything else? Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer. Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out. Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts. That's what Tim said. So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace? Yes, I would. You want a drink? I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either. No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water? Yeah, sure, that sounds nice. I'll get it. I snuck into #21. Why would you do a thing like -- You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. The Day Care? Are you open? Yes. I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important. What's the charge? Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike. We'll find him. No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now. You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here. You think I'm staying? There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons. Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me. How's your precious little school-marm today? She's fine, as if you cared. Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite. Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow? Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella. Lay off once, would you? What'd I say? It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it. Somebody called you? Can we come in? What do you want? We'd like to come in. No, you can't come in. You don't? No. What is happening? Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you. Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you. Then don't talk about killing. Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die. Don't say that. It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. O.K. Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad. There's a shovel at my mother's. But he has nothing to do with it! That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him? My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein - I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane - I'll write it myself. Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on? God, you ask a lot of questions. Can you see? Yes. It is the Western Ocean. He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he? Yes, Ben - he is. He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all. I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President. You got no business snoopin' around -- Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath. Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words? Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut? Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me. Ain't Jemima on the pancake box? Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately. How be dat? I don't know who I am. Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle. Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. Yeah it was okay. Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked. The sets were good. The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever. Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street. Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet? We should be so lucky. Butt-ugly owl. Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them. Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them... Yes, you should go. But then when will we see each other? You idiot! ...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it. Totally... ...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows. Oh... Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday. Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome. My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true? We like to think so, yeah. And you don't deal drugs? Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment. This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things. This could go on for hours. So you're staying in tonight? Do you want to wait to hear me describe death? A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- Then you've gotta ask him about that. He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK! I'll be right back. This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates! An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care... You *invented* him! You've completely made his up! Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*! You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this. Yes, I am, sir. Then what brings you out on such a night? Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me. Oh, I see... That must be a great burden. One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir? No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence. Are you staying with a friend, sir? No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin. Is it a nice warm room, sir? Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street. Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir? Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money. Do you have three francs, sir? Aren't you ever tempted to gamble? Never. Why do you ask? I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time... Gambling's not about money. Really? Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds. I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know. Are you going with her? Yes. I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir Whatta you mean, "horrible? I think I've found a hand. Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was. Oh, what was that? Poker! I see. Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man. In what way? They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal. I see... To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure... Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here? Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there? Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report? I don't, Doc... Arrested on an assault charge five times... That's correct, Doc ... The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that? Doc, what can I tell ya? Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy? No, this is my first trip, Doc. Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation! You bet, Doc! Good. Good. Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now. Right here, sir. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. Why did you park way back there? Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car. Oh. I see. Nothing is going on with us, is it? Going on? When I picked you up from the train station...what you said. What did I say? That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that? That was the truth. You've never said that before. I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit. It sounded like a pick-up line. I can't pick you up. I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis. Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay. Then why do you? And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things? What'd Christine say? Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool. You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. What are you talking about? Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team. Will you please tell me what you're raving about! You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York. You must have me confused with  Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley. No, but there are four guys back there you might check out. Thanks, buddy. One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction. You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay? It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer. You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied. That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist. Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that? Got it Earl. Okay, out. You're not going to phone anybody where I am. Put down that gun, Earl. I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work. Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help. How about I put Nikko on it? That's always your privilege, sir. Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here. You're kidding, that's today? I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house -- All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations -- Uh, sir... Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside. I don't like it. Why not? I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic. He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner. Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and -- -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it. I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? Marion. It's a book. Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it. It's the truth. Without hope there's no point to anything. Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative. Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it. Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan? My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler. You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters. You must understand, this is all new to me... I understand... But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather. You're a good fellow. Where is Lt. Ilia? That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise. Who are you? I'm the Bowler. OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege? We're just closing, friend. Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned! Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours-- Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it? We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman... Name? Gus Gorman. Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go! Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby. David. Please. This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on. ...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret? Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here. Wilfred. ...what have you <u>done</u> to me... All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments... ...what are we going to do...? You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house. Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas? What about you? I don't know. How is everybody? Tolerable well. Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>. He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell. Oh Christ. Doc... Dear God. Love. What? Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave? Um...sure. I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home. OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES! Coulmier, you animal! I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS! Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape! NOW STRIP. Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben. You're Bobby, right? Yeah. Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here. I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these. If I break it they can take it out of my pay. Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something. That'd be great. Well -- take care. That s totally see through... Merry Christmas... Christmas?  It can t be Christmas... Hello, Harold. Frances. Where's Clifford? He's not here. Oh. It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday. It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus. About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country. They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow-- --Darling-- I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother? You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have. I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa. You know where I'm from? Somebody's coming! Shhh!  This way! You take the test? Aye. Clear? Aye. That's nice. I'm sorry, Tommy. Have you got any gear on you? No, I'm clean. Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque. What do you want to do? I'm doing it. Are you a bad boy? Whatiya mean? Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything. What do you want? I want you to hurt me. No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police. The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck. Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know. How far away is filter number four? Five hundred yards. You have a man near it? What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love. He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Laura. I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are. I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more. Be the eagle.  Be the eagle. Be the swallow.  Be the swallow... Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle? Oui, doctor, oui. Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we? Oui. You decide. Today is your day. Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur. Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay? Oui. Perfect! Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here. Gimmie a butt. You don't smoke. I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one! Hi, Richard. What are you doing? Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging. That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future? Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night. That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny. It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time. Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht. For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode. Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion? Like what? Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before? What do you know about hypnosis? Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back. Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it? No offense, but you're pretty out of it now. What are we going to do? The War is Over. There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now. You're what? I am better. May I have this dance? With pleasure, Captain. Shouldn't you be in mourning? I am. You booger. That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green. You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret? Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil. You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone. Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident? I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here. I'll go with ya. What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon. Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone! Come where? Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying. It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die. Don't touch me! I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia. I'm not laughing, Steven. You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin! Haven't they already? This is my job. We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started. Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee -- If you're not here for a 422 -- No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now. I'm sorry. Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright? Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim. Just Jim. yeah, good, ok. Bye, bye, Claudia. Good bye. You have? Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think? That's him. That s Eric! I filmed this the morning they left. Maybe I do. Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be. I think I've heard that before. What do you want for free? You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man. Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything. What? ...And everything is nothing too. Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir? I'm explaining my reasons. Hiya, Walter. Cop. Are you alright?  What is it? Rain. Real rain? Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team. I thought you were done. Pull over! Now! Shit! We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here? No. No one has stopped here in weeks... Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself? Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman. Look at the picture. Please. I'm not givin' it up jus' yet... C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night? It died for your sins. This little corpse is intended as a lesson? There's a certain amount of information there. Lest we forget how cruel you are. I'm in. Anyone else? Anybody know about this? I didn't even know about it. Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like? Is it him? Yup. He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped. And that's why he thinks they're Godly? He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes. You like Jack? <u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy. Hector thinks you like him. Well Hector's a giant cracker. You think Jack's handsome? What is this? I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome? Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah. The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot. Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business. I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay. Chief Talley is the one who got you out. I need to talk to him.  Alone. ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies. What about the gold? Ahem. Vada, just put 'em on the stool. We can try again. Everybody take five. Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore. It's giving. He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold. Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea.... Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ... I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor! Damn! They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior -- The Army can hang him. Tomorrow. Wait a second... I can't... couldn't. It's going to be closer.  You better get going. See you soon. Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing. Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name? Oh, no. Why not? I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me. You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out. It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'. Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond. Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs. No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude... Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable. You haven't once said you like my dress. I like your dress.  It's very bright. Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here? Fuck.  I had them on River Glen. Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ... A name? Yes, a name for the operation. Hammer, you alright? Everything's kosher. Watch him for me. Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus. Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling? They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty. Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg? Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year. So? He does it all by himself. I want to know about Exley. He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating. How'd you get to know so much about him? Are you an FBI man? No -- I'm afraid not. He is the mightiest and fairest of knights. We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go. But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him? You can talk to me. That's what I thought. So let me put it this way... Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ... Agreed. That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise. Quite right! Here you go, Pete. Uh, Uncle Ben, I-- What, want a glass? No. No, that's okay. Good Lord.  What happened to you? Just ran into a little trouble. Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink? No. Hungry? No. I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now. I had a problem getting my car back. You just seem to attract trouble, don't you? Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes? A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch. Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy? A cup of the old chai, sir? No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him. To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair. Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair. Just a manner of speech, sir. Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder. Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee. A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole. I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed. Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes. What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you? Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now. That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear? As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches. Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment. Fine. Sitcom...? And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie! I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes! George, I hate sitcoms. HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!! Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message. Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene. That's right... I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug? It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you? At home alone - where were you? As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems? Get out... Should I stay? It's a beautiful city. You're walking to California? Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city. Oh, a coastal city.  That's good. Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed. What?  No, I know they're civilians... What do you want from me? What? Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money? Do you still have friends on the force? Yes, I still have friends on the force. Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy? What makes you think I could do that? You were a cop. What makes you think I would do that? I'm your son. You got it all worked out, don't you? Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems. Good.  Yes.  Thursday. And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia. For certain, no. But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning. For the third time, yes. Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!  {winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really. Er, I knew you looked different. Remember how they used to stick out? What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real. Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record. I don't think that's necessary. Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record. Very well. As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now. My condolences. His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma. I'll do whatever I can to help. THE PAIN! NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it! You killed Domini, didn't you, witch?? I'm not a witch, you're all crazy! Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded. I find most criminals slip up somewhere... You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise. I promise. Never let go. I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages? Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc. This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years. Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures. It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it. Uh-huh. For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora. It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired. It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead. Agnes... Agnes... The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA. Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us? Counts? Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to -- Did you tell him? No. On you go. That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up? Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead? May I ask where you re from, Mr Lamont? Europe...  France. I m French but I live in London...  ... England. You re a long way from home... It's on the television. Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy. Call me on my cell if you go out. Yeah. Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task. Who are you? Let me talk to the lady again. There's no lady here. If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss. Hold on. If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about. Let her tell you. You like him, don't you? Oh yes. But it takes time. You've known him long? Since his beard was red. I didn't give any order to fire! That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch... You got one now! You know him? Heard of him. I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time... That's all going to change, Yori... How? Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to Wow! It's brilliant! Yeah...  Come on, have a little training. To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including    the excess of virtue itself. That's intelligent. We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy. How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police? Oh, good heavens, no! How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals? Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything. You have no disputes over women? Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted. Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not? Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her. That's very convenient. I think I'd like that. You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems. I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term. I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or... That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy. So you re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That s a down payment on a Ford Focus! Not dollars. Pounds. Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me. Your parents'd kill you. Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney. Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't. Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back. Yah? Oh-you-beccha. The penitent man is humble before God. Penitent. Penitent... The penitent man is humble... Toto's my dog. Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all... Leave her alone, you fiend! Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come. If I could get my hands on you... ..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain. Leave her alone, I tell you! I do not joke in my proposal. Yeah. Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay. You're here quite a bit, then. I live right around the corner. You moved? I been here a couple years. What about money? What about it? I don't have any. Use my credit cards. I can't do that. Why not? It's illegal. Who cares? I'll get in trouble. You are in trouble. Now do it. Phillip? COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY. Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within. They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within. Death may be the result....  Are you sure? I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child? What do you mean, you'd rather die alone? I didn't say when I want to die - You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project. How? The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not. What alien environment? Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future. What about you? My life is over.  Go. Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up. Nope, there!  That's one. Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers? Should we? In case we want to switch nights. I suppose. What you readin'? Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye? Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl? I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is. I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it. Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time. Easy, mon. Later. The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you? I wonder if they're going through this too...? Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4. Yes, Sergeant Hoffman? As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud. Anything else? Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial. Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute? What's it doing? Why do you all keep asking me? He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him. This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire. To shave your chest? We should take a vacation. Whose car? My car! My car! Tan Ciera! Don't go in! Wait for back-up! I'm Chairman? Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected. I'm Chairman. I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple. Ohhhh... You don't mean that. I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to... Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me? I can't go to the club tonight, guys. Why? I'd say you already have. Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk. Is--is something the matter? Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours-- Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you? Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore. Pleased to meet you, sir. A condition... Exactly. A condition. That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal. You could do it. Get out of here.... You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy. Where's it headed? I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us. Four minutes. What? I waited another four minutes. Shit. Wait until he is on the stairs. Right. I'm taking off my mike. Okay. Electra -- What? Last night -- That man, then, he was the first.  The first you -- Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate? Aces, Suits. Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big? Pretty much. In over your head? Pretty much. Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him. But you didn't. No. Poetic justice, though. Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig. What up, bro? You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving. ... My ... social situation? You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees. What plan? The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford. What is it with this chick?  She have three tits? This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place... Just get back here! No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest! Hey! Julie... Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth. Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan? That what they call you? No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help. You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly. No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out. So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day. Yes, nurse. There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up. Boss loader! Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers. And for all that dough I don't do nothin'? Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid? Yeah  yeah  I guess I do  but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley. You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against  I don't know  I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals  you know what they're worth to us? I know. I know. Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped  Don't say that!  ex-tanker who's walking on his heels  ? Don't say that! What the hell!!! I could have been better! The point is  there isn't much time, kid. Pop asked you. I'm gonna kill somebody today. What's the matter? You fixed this suit?  Beth? Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous. My air isn't... I'm coming back. You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time. Do we have to? I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible. What do you know about trilogies? You mean like, movie trilogies? You seem to like movies, Detective. Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney. I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective. All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off. Did you request this case? No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios. Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people. To me Hollywood is about death. Excuse me? I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that. What do you mean? I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone. Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts. Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott. Hmm. What did you know about your mother? I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it. Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news. How is that good news? Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that. Oh yeah, how? Catch him, or kill him. Can I talk to you a minute? Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there. You've got a couple of hours, maybe. To do what? I can't answer that. What will they do to you? That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere? You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me. Right - about face! March! First rank present! Fire! You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression... That's quite a change of subject. What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking... I'm trying hard to follow you. If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away... I'm beginning to catch up. If we could cast it properly, that is... Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it? You've got to admit it would be a novelty. Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve. I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out. Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday. Thanks a lot. Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK? Sorry, mistress. Here's to music. And absent friends. And absent bridegrooms! And the bride. Yeah, I just.... Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly. And only then does our noble friend realize... ...that the prey can bite back. Let me have those. Senora Cruz? Quien es? [Who is it?] Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid] Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground. I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose? Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter. Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you? I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again. Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness. Proceed. If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness. What's that? Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits. You a God damn witch? Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico. Will that work for me? If you believe in Voodoo. I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit. What?  That's horrible! What happened? You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you! What now, Sonny? Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ... Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here. Thank you. Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices. V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information. This is insane. Perhaps it is. You know I thought you'd left me back there. What are you talking about? Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries. Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse. ...done right, you gotta do it yourself. Then do it the way you want. Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once. Really? Don't talk about it much, though. You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting. Thank you. You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney? Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift. From a -- girlfriend. No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client. No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you? Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans. This isn't working out for me anymore. Yeah, me neither. Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtw ngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtw ngler. But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday. He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand. I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need? Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you? Nope. Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you. Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker. Used to be my partner. You really had other offers? I'm sure I could have. That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too? If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year! I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago. Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup. Sure. Hello George. Shermin... What's all this for? We have a new directive. I'm taking over. We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time. Washington thinks it's too late for that. I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you. You're not hearing me. You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him. We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear. That's the chance we have to take. No, we don't. Then you're going to have to do it without me. You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us. You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that. I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy... I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight. Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye. What about Mrs. Moebius and...? They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city? A week or so. There's something I want to do here first. What's that?  Okay. Surprise us... <i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television. Be kind to your sitter. Shoot no, not after all these years. Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine! He can't help us. Do something! Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this. You are, I've seen you. It wasn't me. It was him. It was you. He told me what to do. But you did it. It was you. I... Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up... I... We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>. I'm very sorry I... You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him? I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But... That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing? Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator. So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six? Precisely. ... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it. That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men. Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns! That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye. Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash. Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli? White supremacist types. It's a military hotel. I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books. We should sleep in shifts. Right.  Half of us awake at all times. You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth. Ow!   Are you all right? No. ...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby -- Wait a minute! Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot. Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do. This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it? What? Nothing. Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel. Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf. What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight? You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear? No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me. You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do. Yeah, uh-huh... Okay. So what? You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her? Now what? Jump! But... won't you be de-rezzed? Probably. He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath... Who?  Your husband? And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of... Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis. I see. Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years? Yes. It's a very good show. I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner. Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait. It better be good. There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them? No. I'll probably marry him. Really?  That's sudden. My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano. Not exactly. I guess you have your reasons. Yes. Help Chase. I'll be back. Did Two-Face call him Bruce? Was that your dad? Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor. Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno. He had a pressing engagement. Philistine. Wake up, young lady, that's our train. Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it. What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness". That's him.  Simon Doucet. Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble. This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning. Well, he's sure working fast ain't he? I want this bastard brought down. Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse. I rode here, on my horse. Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses. Pack up. I'll see you get back to London. Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one. This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room. Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch -- Okay.  Here she comes. Oh, I'm sorry. What're you doing? I'm sorry. Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent. The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake. My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him. What is your uncle's name? O'Grady. Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady... What are you an idiot! The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed. The University cannot do this. Is the room safe? Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building. Nothing but civilians, Gene. This is bullshit - we don t even know what Max looks like. Maybe we don t have to know what he looks like.  If he s got that list, he s going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops. Good idea. I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her. That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami   for the love of it? Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get. Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose. don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in  If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want? No, thank you -- what's your name? Belle -- Thank you, Belle -- Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you? My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value. Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it. Long live the First Amendment. Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can. Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period? Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to. Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison. Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all. Sue them. I'll sue. This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so. I'll be fine. She said convincingly. We certainly did. We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy-- Louis, please -- ! My guards are useless!  Take her from me! How's Brad? A wreck. Check.  The quacks are willing tools? Fools! I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours. Time to check with Flavors. I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat! None of us like it! Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem. Just take it in stride. I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out. Do you have bandages? In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us? The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes. So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her. What's that? We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night. You're going out? We're going to bed. Come back and get me. We will. Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes! Yeah. Thank God we got you away from her, huh? Let's hear it. Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines. That'll blow the ship up. Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship. Is that you? Me. Yes. Oh. And that is -- mom? Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother. You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes. What is it that I can't figure? What do you mean? Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good. There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin! Oh God... ...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind. Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism   if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath. Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you? You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople? Monescu! Gaston Monescu. Gaston! Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum. Phasing? To where? Oh? Anything else? Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows. What? Maybe you resent how busy I've been. What are you...?  No. You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow. Sabotage? Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or... The accident...? But then you've been so much better... Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not... Sweetheart-- No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you. You can't get away from me, Albert. I know. Someone beat you. Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright? Grave robbers? Probably. Who? People like that rarely leave business cards. Does Carl Smith? BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more. B-L-A-K it is. I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit. Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good. Really, Sail, I'll be okay. It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot. What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there. He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too. How can you say that, Sailor? What makes sense, is all. He can't reach us in here.  We're safe. I know. Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible? Possible.  But not darn likely. Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay? I would if I knew where I was taking him. Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives? Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it. That strikes me as odd. James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember. Why would you do such a thing? No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh... I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel. You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes. What are you on about? The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly. Must I hear this? There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother. And this gives worth to butchery? It was not butchery. What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest? I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it. Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want? To avenge his father, and the others. But, why?  Tell me why. Now what? There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us. Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing? I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed. Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up. ... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon. Yes? I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so. Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours. I remember that speech really well. I had you pegged, didn't I? You had the whole human race pegged. Probably. I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that. I know. It would be different, if we could just give it another go around. Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can. Bob. I didn't... Swear. I swear -- Swear on Jimmy's grave. This is cute. Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real. Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ? You don't. It's random, there no trick. Great... Here you go... You re kidding me... She s your dog, Jack. No, she s not. Fine, she s the kid s dog.  Let s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her. But it s twenty degrees outside... You re having a bad day, I ll go with you...actually, there s no way in hell you re gettin  me back out there... So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction? That's correct. But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times? Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so-- -- so you shut them off? Is this supposed to be an apology? It s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings-- I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this? I am. Talk to us about it... It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about. Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier. Mr. Nasty time? Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl. Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here. You too, sweetheart... Thank you. What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? Barely. You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you? That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got? Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security... No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you? I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared. Hello Peter, so good to see you. Hello Marge! Tom. So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist. Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies. Look, Ma, no wires. You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour. How the fuck do you do that? Now I'm going to have to kill you. I don't think so.  You need me alive. Why?  So you can fuck my wife? It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell! Get more men up there! Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening. That's okay, Eddie, I do. Steering wheel... What. What is this, Rogoff? I don't know yet. Not until Ben is back inside! It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us. We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you. I appreciate that. Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held! He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so? M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you. In a moment. Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty. Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished. Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky. Yeah, I guess. My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin. Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep. Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through -- Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson! Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money. Yes, sir. I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet. Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas. You don't want to give away all your books. I aim fer you to have 'em. Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why? Yes sir. I've got a feelin' today. Reckon what kind of a feelin'? Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl? Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to? You know I would. Whatever you want. Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it. Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right? Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here. Okay. Coming. Women are always late.  You'll find out. I go with this here... Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why? What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark. That's just it, Michael.  We don't! What do you mean, we don't? This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long! Thirty feet??? Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on. I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down. Ouch!  That really hurt! I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . . That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy. Don't tell me -- -- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and -- Benjamin -- this is my mother! -- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked -- I'd give anything to have been there. I'm ready to communicate with you now. Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day! He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>. Stop farting around.... Stop busting my hump.... Try the area around the wreck.... Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another. But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves. That isn't the way it works. But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean? No more stalling, Captain. Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference -- Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years... It looks wonderful. You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ... Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says. Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry. That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same. I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City. Charlie Luciano. You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke. Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do. The goddamned bastards. Tell me about it. Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want. You need money again? No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got. You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me. Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know? I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that? I just wanted some make-up. All that shit's on aisle 5. And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat. And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day? Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper! So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time. Do you hear him? Do you? I just had a terrible thought Harry. What's that? I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon. Why d'you think these seats were empty. There's nobody here. Jason... Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here. Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams. Nah uh. Or an on-line computer. That's crazy! What about that other guy? I promise, Jack... Promise me again... I promise. Come to bed, honey. The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir. Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in. How are you? Very well. Thank you. Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium? Could be. I don't have all day, kid. Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on. All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice? I'm looking for a party -- a merry party. Well, that's illuminating. Of course I recognised him! You did? I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat. I'm sleepy. You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine. The green capsules in the top drawer. The point is to not call attention to ourselves. I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them. We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know... This weekend? This was before her pregnancy? About two years before. Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this? Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving! He's gonna die! They'll kill him! Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal! You're the animals - all of you! How have you ... ? Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys. He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it... What are you doing? Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game... Fuck you. Yeah. I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa. Kenny's aunt? Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you. Admiral! There be whales here! Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed? I'll have to re-energize. Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb. I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything? I don't think, he can't... ...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say... What are you talking about? You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there... By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives? Why not?  They seem friendly enough. Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes. How many of those drinks did you have? Three. I thought so. What generation are you? Nexus - 6. I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes. Why? The guys is ready to deal now. Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner. Now that's down-right insulting. I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules. No, Bud, no... not you. Who then? What's he doing? The best he can since you gave him nothing. Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton. Maybe she knows your old man. I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him. Who? Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball. What's so great about baseball? If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is! I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call! What happens if you don't? Yes sir. I do, Sir. Well? Sir. I was going Mach point one five. I didn't look like a bum. But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going. General Greely says it looks like the Middle East. Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean? Oh, Mr. Den-n-by! Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary? I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup? All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup? When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute? Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left-- Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts. What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one! Well, I didn't but... I just don't think it would work. Why wouldn't it? You'd fuck your uncle! YOU'D fuck your uncle! <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b> <b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b> How was the flight, Champ? Very high an' very fast. So, you finally got a job Morgan? Had one, now I'm fucked again. So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house? ...Mm. Well? How'd she do? Tyler... I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus. I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart. Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife. That's not it. Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know. Really? Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright. I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy. Yeah.  Neat. Don't come any closer!!! Cut it out stupid.  It's me. My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe... I don't believe it! Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it? He cheats. Hi. Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag. Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you? Wow! Look at all these creeps! Shh! OH MY GOD! I'll settle for a third of that. And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that? True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl? YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON` I know him too. Who? Sid Fletcher. Oh, do you? Yes. No, do you really? Are you okay? I think so. Hello? Mr. Van Dorn? Mast? Yeah. Where are you? The connection sounds very good. I'm back in Grand Rapids. In G.R.? Why? Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel? I've got a meeting... What are you paying me for? I'll be there. Can't we at least talk about it? I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship. But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing? It's dead. Try the pay phone. Do you have a dime? A quarter? No. There must be some in the desk somewhere. You're drunk. You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so -- Direction's east coming! What was that? Catch you back at the wall. Later. Time to cut a rug, Z! I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders. Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper. I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss... Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities... ... Love is shown through actions not just words. What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement. What it is -- is the truth. I don't follow. Finally, some common sense... What do you mean? I think you know what I mean. No, I really don't. I think you do. Why don't you tell me? Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it. Okay, we're back in. That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist. Well, thank you, Mary. Who were you talking to? Them.  They won't be expecting us. Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them. Nobody can do anything right but you! Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten? Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning. Give me the keys, Dignan. I can't do that, Bob. Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt. Don't threaten me, Bob. Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God -- How do you know? I just know. Say more. They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork. And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved? I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. Is Sandy part of this? No. not at all. Who knows you have these? Only you. and the photo lab. You're all through with this now? Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it? First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out. Hey man-- Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line! Miss me, baby? I dunno, boy. Hm? It's a bitch. A bitch. Didn't recognize you. We've never met. I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants. I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't. I'm gonna wet my pants. Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to. Oh.  That's nice. Yeah. Which direction? That way. Any particular reason? None at all. Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy? Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber? What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B? You got your vest? Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car. Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too. It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now. Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me. You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us. Really? Really... I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us. Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live. How long's this been going on? Since the murder. She was fine before that. Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell. It's just made her think... her dreams are real... Are you asking me a question? Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms? No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too. Who gives a damn? Yes... Yes. You look... Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish? No. You look... What is it like to fly on a plane, sir? It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama. That is why they call it coach? Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates. You have taken business class? Many times. Scream. During sex. Ahem. Vada, just put 'em on the stool. Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her. What? The Bahamas? You're kidding. What the hell is that, anyway? Cannon fuse. What do <u>you</u> use it for? My cannon. What are you thinking about? Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself? Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in? Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully. My name's Johnny Utah! Who cares! I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him. How long has he been having problems? Since forever. Have they done blood tests on him? Yes. Only in the emergency room or when he was well. Emergency room only. Have they done skin testing for allergies? No. They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin? No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway. It's amazing these things weren't done. Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me. No. Actually, I think that's their technical name. Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results? Me. My home number is on this card. His home number. Been waiting long? Just got here. How'd we do? A.D. is a C.P.A. Come again... ? Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got. Maybe it's enough. You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense. Fuck no. I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want. We'll exterminate the fuckers ! What...No! Put it in the carton. Sorry. Jean? What? Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to? What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13] Why not? I'm hungry. Eat a carrot. Never!  I'm going in and ask him  If you do, I'll break your neck. Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts. Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus? Yeah. Would you take him? It's bone dry, Morty. It's not completely dry. Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon. Aren't you going to thank me? What's it about? A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident. Are you sure this is a real dance? Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up -- Really? Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow. You're right! You -- you think I'm right? Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo! Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected. Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P-- So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein. Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it. Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk? Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it. Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good. Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter. You've done five of my ideas. You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters? They don't have to be in the office Christmas show? A flack jacket. A--flack jacket. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls. You don't think I can grab bulls' balls? Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five. Hey--I can be out of control. You loved him? I'm very cold. Well, Mozart is already rehearsing. Incredible. The Emperor has given him permission. Where did he go?  He was just here. Who? Joey. I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science. Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here. Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure? Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money. OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI- OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE-- Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately! It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady. Grady... oh. You gonna carry that around all night? Yeah... I'll paint on it. I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you. Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts -- Wheee!  Faster! How fast is enough? I want to go faster! C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up. So, what now? I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude. Will you two lovebirds keep it down? What what are you doing? We're cover! Wood's okay. I want Viper. I don't see any. Funny. Funny...   I better go to bed. All moorings are clear, Captain. Thank you, Mr. Saavik. Enzo? What? Your mother? Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant. What it is? Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned. I thought Jason was only a legend? He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding. Hey, Sam... ...I want to say a thing. What's that, Sam? Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from. Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight. Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal. Don't worry about it, pal. What's the matter? This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...? You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. I have to talk to you. Doug, this is Mr... Butch called. Did he? He did. It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age. Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there. I want more life, fucker. Come here. This is all too familiar. Over here. You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that? Uh, no. Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..? Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that! Don't want to film this? Hey everybody. How's it hangin'? In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year. Frank, take it easy. what happened? He flipped out. Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close. We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah-- Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way... And I might have something important to tell you... What is it, a surprise? That's right... No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max. Only way I could stand your ties. ... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me. Did you meet Captain Kirk? You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope. Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true. My God. We're in? The cheese... You're leaving right now? Yes. Well... have a good flight. Thanks. Ok, bye. What's going on? Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer. He stole my wheel! This is pathetic. I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail! Hi, Ma. I've been calling and calling. I got caught up at work. You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened... I brought you flowers. What am I gonna do with flowers? You're gonna cheer up. By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt? He paid for 'em. You were contracted to work- -malaria epidemic; very sudden. Let me see the sick. Oh, you're a doctor now, too? There is no reason for fear. On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben. Hi Sandy. I feel better. Do you? Yeah, I do. What's the matter, Sugar? I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty. What's her name, anyway? What do you care? I'm telling you, it's the suits! Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened! Departing dark side, Regula. Visual -- What is she saying? She says that Ali is still in the Casbah. Where are we? Someplace safe. How you feeling? Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock... Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you.. Been over to the other mill? Yeah, I been there. It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise. Oh yeah? That's good. You go?  Not watch fun? I have something far more pleasant awaiting me. As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast. A what? A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat. No food? No food.  Not until sundown. Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus. What do you mean, sir? Who's the married man? What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up? Benny, God, take it easy... I don't want to scare them away. Alyssa. Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage? I'm living here while I build another house. Is that legal? I've got a pulse, he's alive... Pressure? 90 over 50 and falling... . He's crashing... Hold it a minute, Benny, willya? It's too clean. Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and... It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930. Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while. What is that? It's frogs.  It's raining frogs. ...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs? It's raining frogs from the sky. ....what the fuck, what the fuck.... This happens....this is something that happens. What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? Keep going. Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list... Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that? I think so. One right, two lefts... And a right. Right. I wouldn't give ya a nickel. Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets. How is she? She is upstairs. I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff. Fine. I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing. I don't hear any-- Shut up and listen! Yes, sir. Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment. You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible. Thanks, Sheriff. Hi. Well, stop the world. Quit my job. Great. Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing? Spanish. How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish? Something mi trabajo. You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her? You can turn that finger around. We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary. Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems! Do you have a cigarette? I don't smoke. Yes, you do. I quit. This is a drug deal?! That, and your thing.						   * Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol. Hey, how are you? Hungry. Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup. Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name? What do you want to know that for? Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you. Call me Sonny-boy. Sonny-boy, one word? One word.  You won't find it in the phone book. Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short? Call me whatever you want. Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess. I frisk you? You frisk me. Right -- I'm with you, buddy. I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right? Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you. How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position? They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then. Okay, give us the women. Oh, no ... Women is all we got. You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ... So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do. I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through. Maybe plans changed... Plans don't change... Where were you? To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name-- Well? She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all. Goodnight, Joe. Goodnight to you, Susan. Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here. He work for us? Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview. What ? You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ? Just throw me the ball, Diz. Very professional. I am a professional man. Lips still for sale? You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue. Can you change something this big? Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities. I think it's great. This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest. Keep it. Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars? Hey, what's your problem? I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around. That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve... It doesn't seem to be in any hurry. He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's -- I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here. A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff. Let me see the plant press. Now hold him. I'm a real light sleeper, Childs... Enough, MacReady! We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much. Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed? What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head? I told you lay off. My ain't we touchy this morning? What's up with you? Bladder infection? Keep it up. I'm walking there Kris. Walking where? California. What's that? It's a surprise. It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!! I'm sure it feels very real to you -- On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it? Relax now, Sarah -- You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead! Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan. Ten seconds, Rod. And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it... Dad, I really think we should call the cops. No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing! Yeah, but - We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty... George... I just have to do one little thing. If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you. I won't screw you up. Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be? You may call me Leia. You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break. Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens. Hold on a second! Look at this, it's so lean and clean. Looks like a hacker wrote it. Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business... Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys? Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it. You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are. Where are we going to go, mommy? We're going to go someplace new. What about all my other stuff? We'll get it later. Um, yeah, I was gonna ... What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision - Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry. Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me? I batted! You batted or you bunted? Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday. Well, then I'm quitting. Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late. Who's in it? Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully. Look, I don't know what this... Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat. I thought you were asleep. You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up. We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble. This is a delicate matter. Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter? What do you have in mind? The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs. One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him. Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh. Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this. Oh - and what's so stinking about it? It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again. Sir Gawain. Ector. Thank you, friend. Let's go. Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this. Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be-- Pa! Shh! How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he? No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead! Kristen's story really got to her. I wasn't sure you caught that. I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out... Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while. Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? Come in, Alfredo. Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke. What's it to you? I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business. Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys? Put my car in the garage and close the door. John, I don't understand any of this. You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy. John, why?... Just do it! I'd strongly advise you to join us-- --before you lose your emotional lunch. Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!! Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't. Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole! Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out! There's something pathetic parked in front of my house. Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it. I'm still waiting for the mortgage check. I mailed it to you on Wednesday. Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here. Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office. Well?... Whaddya want to know? My sign? No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey? Having fun. Is this fun? Driving? Driving, talking to me... They're both a challenge. You have a great profile. Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle. Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie. I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say. Maybe it ain't coming. Then we go after him. Bet the last place you ever go. So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa. Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting. Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe. Really? Shouldn't you be sitting down? No, I'm all right. I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability? No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town. What can I do for you guys? We want some grass. I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops? No. Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment. We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop? I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you. Goodnight. I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name. The maitre d' called you Christine. Right.  Call me Christy. Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you. Give me an address so I can send your shirt back. Keep it. The one with the V.P.L. V.P.L.? Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous. Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you? There are no twos, Max. Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering. M'hm. And... uh- How do you like this couple, Max? When the left hull goes, so will the right. What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship? Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to... Joey... Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach... Joey... Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again... ...taping?  What are you taping? I'm doing an interview. An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry. Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent. I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off! That's not the case. Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me. It's possible. I don't know about that. I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area? Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place. Quite a place. Thank you, Henry. For what? This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere. Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take. None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face -- You shouldn't use my name. Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent? She's still talking to Jesus. What worries me is that Jesus is talking back. In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow. Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain. It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence. Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence. Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins. Nepal? Have you been? Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place. You own a home there? Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu. Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops? Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway. I thought I knew everything about him. Can we split now? Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets. You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid. Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why? I ain't interested in your life story. Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her. She's the one to blame. Not me. Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic. I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight. Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week. I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty. I'll bet it's a fortune. This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore. I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary? I wish I knew. So do I, Charley. For your sake. What do you want me to do, Johnny? Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him. Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid. Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here. Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny. Then don't. But my own kid bro  This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny? I found a rubber. White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress. Thelma. Yeah. I want you to call Darryl. What for? To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped. Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so? Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma! Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense? But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away! They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth! It won't work. Why not?! No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now. What time are visiting hours? I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning. Well. Okay. Jeffrey, when you see your father. Yeah? He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you. What? It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him. Thanks a lot, Mom. .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so. Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges. What? The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know? Thanks. We're all here for you Trevor. We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen. So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me. You practically bribed him with your erector set. He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake? No.  Do you? What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut. No. She's not. Initiate launch sequence. Activating injector assembly. That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed. Quit complaining; we're in space. Mookie. Gotta go. C'mere, Doctor. How can I help you, Mr. Wayne? Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion. Bandit II? I'm here. You're coming up to the scale house. I'm cucumber cool. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time. What's your problem now, Lieutenant ? The Rodger Young just burned up... She's really kind of hot. She's an attractive older woman. Get the cops, somebody. Come on, fellas. Big trouble. Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done. Pritchett! Over here! How's Peterson's holding up for you? It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel. Rest, William. I rest. Your rest is making me exhausted. Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey! Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. Whoa!  What the hell was that?! Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses! I'm sorry ... No! Sabotage? I don't understand... I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub? You have no right to blame Duval -- That line was tampered with... I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession. You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind... I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident. Two in a row? It's possible -- He's burning up. Total delirium. He'll never make it. That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. Push 'em back. Help me! Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits. Thanks for the ride. I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him? So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up. Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them. I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station. Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend. The ah... the radio's out. What? Somebody took it out of commission last night. Please. You got to. All right... I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent". Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven? Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose. No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason. Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk. He told me he was turning in early... What happened? Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett. Is he going to be okay? Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave. So, we won't be going to London? No, not just yet. So what happened ? He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back. Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N. Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes. We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch. Meaning? Meaning it didn't land in the water. Please.  It must have flown here -- It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here. Arrived?  From where? Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future. Is it all fugasi? No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker. When? I saw you waiting there, by the gate. I... I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds. Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?! It hurts.  Aw, Jesus! Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby. I'm hungry. Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday. What did all this stuff cost you? When you've got money, you'll pay. No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score. The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted. Don't you ever cook anything? Eggs. How do you like them? Raw. I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to. Appreciate it, sir. May I cut in, miss? You're still my best girl, Cora. So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans? I've got my Seahaven Bankcard. So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this. Do you know what C.P. Time is? C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance. You're a fuckin' mess. So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay. I'm going to my mother's. Does she have room for me? Pretty impressive, huh? It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country. From where -- Neptune? They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland. Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town. With his hands! But why would they do that...? Please come, please. W... I can't wait for you to meet her! Who makes all these? I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day. You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her? Did you find Jane and Mandy? Could you call me back on your phone? Right away. What's wrong with the radio? Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>. Stand by. Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up. Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey? The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original... Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here. I'm going to uphold that. I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock. Let me get this straight, are you asking me out? Yes. Unbelievable. Seven it is. I'll think about it. This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it. She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off? I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run. Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me. It's going to Sonora. Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime. Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby? I ain't doing bad. Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got? Okay, thanks. I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay? Okay, okay. Bye. He never showed it. He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you. Mr. Lipnik, I   I apologize, Barton. No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help   You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business. Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider   Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts. He just came up screaming. Did he say anything? He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead. And you didn't see <u>anything</u>? The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there. <u>There</u>?  That's the morgue. Yes. Is the dead guy in there? That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here? Um.  No, no.  Let's go. Bad beat today. Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...? You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep. Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise. It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay? That's terrible! You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed? I don't think I can go on, sir. What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you -- I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night. Let's get back and call this in. Wait a minute. The other thing is... ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs. They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here. We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options. What is wrong with you? I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this. You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people. Really? No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float. Okay. Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'. I   Mr. Lipnik   KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!! What's this? Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you. But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight. You aren't coming with me. And how's Yurek? Dead. How well did you know him? I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know. Yale thing? This is a Lifestyles hotel. What? Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this. Are you sure? Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here. Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else. <u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America. Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out... You were right. Del wasn't lying. Well, you were right about what that bartender said. A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. Is that Donald Trump's car? Oh God, Patrick. Shut up. You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump. I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- -- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it. You think it'll send this guy back to hell? Correct, And that's when -- Hi, whatcha doing? Just thinking. Good a way to kill time as any... She okay? I know how to get outside the shield. Where do we come in? Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you? Possibly. I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months. Candidate for what? Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along. I haven't read that. I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*. But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped? When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you? Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all. Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more- The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do? It'll do fine. Nice, huh? Beautiful. Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care. Miles. She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines. Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding. I know. You told me. I'm okay with it. Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried. She what?  When? About a month ago. Six weeks. To that guy? That guy with the restaurant... That's the girl I love. But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house. As opposed to twenty angry women? Who are you? I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here? He's asleep. We were up very late. Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley. Mrs. Gordon. Thank you. Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer. Something about my father? Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal. Can't it wait, then? Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold? Jabez! Mary -- what would you do? Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same. Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn. She's getting undressed. Gimme the binoculars. No.  It's not right. Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you. I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away. You can. No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go... Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths. You think this is all a joke? Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island? Ian's a very good friend of mine. He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink. I believe in him. For yuh. Okay, that's good. Aren't you glad we waited? I don't know.  It probably would've been the same. Well, thanks a lot. Another little problem. What do we do now? The show must   you know Go on. Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right. How will it? I don't know. It's a mystery. How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet? It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it? Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'... It was a man though... right? The police think he was high on drugs... No, I mean, no big whoop. I can't do this. One called Magua arrived. He delivered no such message. Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence. Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French... French? Yes sir. French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture! Thanks, miss. You're too kind. I'm Amanda. Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore. Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities. Huh? I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me. What is it? Someone's following me. Who? Sister Marguerite I think. Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night. So you like bookstores, huh? I like to read. Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way. Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But -- The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember? Sort of, um... Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry. What? I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me. Yes, Mr. Galvin? If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way... I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence? Great. I'm gonna clean it up. What film? Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him. It's not right, Gale... It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time. What do we do? We change the scam? There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk. No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about? Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car. ...okay. Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use? I still don't under -- We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI. Are you busy tomorrow night? No. Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay? Sure. As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder. Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager? Fifty shillings.  Pounds. Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA. Good morning. Can I do something for you? I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here? I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank. Bank? Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time. I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like? You all right? Yeah. Why're you crying? I'm not crying. -- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there... Didn't you have any panties on? -- He reached up and tore them. What did you do? Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was. No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time? No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything. <u>It's uncanny</u>. What's uncanny? LOOK AT HIS SKULL! Who the hell is he? Who the hell knows! we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions. What lions? I'm not going near any lions. We only have to shove'em over the moat. I don't even know how much money that is. It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough. It would explain the suction- like appendages. Like a leech. Hal's signalling he's OK. They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe. Is that the man who called you up here? Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here. Medical clinic? Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains. Well, let's go talk to your doctor. For what? Honesty. Oh, geez. Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal. Geez, I -- Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying. Yessir. Well, why don't ya read it. Sir? Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'. Yes sir... I didn't see you there. Can I help you? My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board. See you. See you, Bob. What are you doing -- Sis. Let me take care of you for once. But Johnny... you can't fly. I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here. I'm not sure... I don't know. Well, what do you want to know? And why? It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off. Sure -- take him to the vet. I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days. Do it. Stop the car! Let us out! Oh, my. We're too late. Is he all right? He's fallen asleep, as usual. Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me? You got no idea... Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT. Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on. Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one? Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions. Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans. Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it! Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks? I don't know, Mulder. And where are they going with it? That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them. Truth is, I'm a little nervous. YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous? All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure. Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure! I do? You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms. Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me. Aye, sir. Deanna, on my mark. Ready, sir! Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take? All he can. All he can. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years. That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty. Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles? Valiant!  You surprised me. That was the idea. What they call you? Red, and I ain't no punk. You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks. Just tell me where it hurts, baby. What? I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think? Excuse me, I'm talking to you. No, you talkin' at me. Do you trust me? Implicitly. Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob. I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired. Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead. Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie. And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now. She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire. Who is that horrible friend of yours? Madmartigan. Who is he? I don't know much about him. Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree? Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear? --or incredibly fucking naive. Hey, folklore-- Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus? I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you... Dies? You may not like what you hear. I can take it. They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came. All right!  Tell us about the truck! Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here. When do we bring'em back? You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of... It won't hold. All I need is the one day. It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie -- Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China? Syevodnya? Syevodnya Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late? I gave him twenty. Very well. Very well. Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer. Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out. Range: 3000 Kellicams. Steady. Continue on impulse power. Right. It was extremely stupid. I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to -- I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob? Man, I don't want to go into this. Ich weiss nicht. Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande... Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain. From over the mountain -- Hmmm. This shit isn't bad. Manure... is life. Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse. Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command. Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work. Us. Lead us not into... ...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and... Mom? All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights. Thanks, Mom... Dad? You go. Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were. I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know? What? About forever. No. Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect. What's the matter? Nothing... Let's get crazy! Shut up. I didn't say a word. Machines do not EAT message. Look, I... Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart. Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse. How did you hear this? He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success. How's the trailer? Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from. Frost. Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out. Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt? Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee. Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him. No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off. He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars. Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold. He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet. He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit... Oh, God.  It's starting. It's just a party. Daddy. Oh my god, I thought-- I'd taken the Mask? I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain... Why did she have to die? Only God knows the answer to that. I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever! I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace. Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!! Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne! Holy shit... Puffy, get over here. All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away- Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches... She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul? I don't care what she wears. Something's made you sore. Don't worry about it. You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong? It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that? I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so? She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far. Kid--kid-- And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts! What's this? Don't! You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight. Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here. How much? I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten. You think it's that good? I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got. Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me? Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. Good, I hate long waits. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Stu...Stu... IT'S NOT WORKING. There's a thing here! There's a switch! I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing. Every day? What else is there to do? You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school. Do I have to? You'll have to make up your own mind about that. I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life! All right.  I'll second that. To put the rout all that was not life.  And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  Pledge Overstreet. What time is it? It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you. Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood. They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised. It's your move, Miles. I already made my move, Kenneth. In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars. Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser. I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage. If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible. You'll be there to see it; you'll be there. I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me... Will you just do what the hell I tell you... I did, didn' I, El? You got another ball comin'. After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds. I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly... I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being? Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play? Um, because you didn't want to go. Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start. Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him. I don't know what we're facing. I understand. Don't start. You think I -- I have no idea. What's on your mind? Don't -- It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup. What do you mean? Don't be dim. Elena, what are you're talking about? I'm not surprised. Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again -- Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it. Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say? It's a starting place. Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after? If you're going to insult me -- What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here. By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it? Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did. Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way. The stock's going to Pluto! Start unloading. Sell? Now! Tell everyone to dump! I wonder where they're going. Same place we are. Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted. Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do. I seem nervous, huh? I got it. It's on the college. Are these yours? Yeah, they are but... Come on! I hope we have enough stuff to do the job. Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy? Bullshit.							* His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 * Trip?? She left me. Crabs. Left you...? Who? Emily? This morning. I found a note in the kitchen. But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here? Oh, thank God. I'm still here. I was so afraid you ... You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you. Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post. Thank you. Would you care to take it, sir? Yes. Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack? Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed... Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love... And we're going away for a holiday. For a month. A month. Right and don't embellish. I promise.  I won't. What are you doing?! I warned you yesterday. Don't touch me!  You can't touch me! It's the lights. And the scotch. How come you didn't catch your bus? I wasn't waiting for a bus. Then why go to the bus station? Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live? Around. I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker? Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning? Do you always ask so many questions? No, not always. Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack? You show Claire these sketches? Yes. Did she throw up? That isn't very nice. Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes? I can't tell. Why not? She won't stop crying... Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad. No. Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting. Why not me?  What am I - the closing act? On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect. Why? I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers. I'm surprised you didn't write one about me. I'm still working on it. Accident. You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower. I'm very interested in this but is there someplace... Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you? ...What? There's something I have to tell you... Oh dear, are you actually laughing? No. No? Are you frightened? All the time.  I feel like I have no one. You sure you won't come with me? And leave all this?  Not in a million. That was uncalled-for. I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink? Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on. Oh, God. What?! They're pushing us over the cliff. What if I couldn't get to you? I was scared of what you were gonna do. When I found you? If I didn't go. Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid? No. I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you? No. Look, you don t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who s the guy? The Austrian? Who s the guy? Who s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I d have had to kill him. Hi.  Sorry I'm late. The back door was open. Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah. Yeah? I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid. Uh-huh. I don't know. We'll break up the furni... You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie? He used to know me. Sorry, Alan it's been six years. Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively... Well-well, like what? Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang. What are you saying? Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name? No... You're his sister, right? Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well. Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan. I know.  Uh...Alice. I'm sorry, I just hallucinated. Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party. Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard. The Boston Strangler, when was that...? In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison. Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything -- I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there. And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt. You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently? Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on. There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good. What is it? That should do nicely. That's a lie! It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there! That's a lie! Listen don't believe what he says . . . Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that? That's got nothing to do with it! Were you paid for it or weren't you? Yes! I was paid! But the  And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either! What difference does that make? Did you write it or didn't you? No, I didn't write it, but  Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it! Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started  There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people they ought to run you out of the country and I hope they do it! Goodnight, Joe. Goodnight to you, Susan. Are you there? Miles? Yeah, I'm here. I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back. So I guess that's it. You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged. Alex... You didn't hear me? Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us -- Something good -- The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help. And the ten thousand? Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late-- I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you. Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you-- Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy! The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness. Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes. I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can. That depends on the man. See you. Probably not. Yeah. Probably not. What is your name? Christian Svenson. Farmer? Yes, ma'am. Where is your farm? South Dakota north. South Dakota - north? South Dakota - but on the top. Oh. Oh! Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits? Right now? Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out. Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all? Yes ma'am. Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy. Mustard's good on 'em to me. Okay. One shouldn't live alone. Some people prefer it. No... it's wrong. I was like yes! I'm going out with him! That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex. Yep. Because he can like climax you up to that... I have seen him again.  Last night. But you've not told Michael. Tell me where we're going. Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts! What's this all about, Connie? Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait... Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written. I think you're right. Does that about do it? I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one. Who -- Give it up.  If you threw yourself- At you?  Polly want a kiss? We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one. You do? All right -- give it to him! Are you serious?? Give him the sedative! Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

We coulda got two third-class! No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome. Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into. It'll never hurt you---Got any money? A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it! No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy. I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. Marty! It's me. Paul. Paul? You're leaving me hanging here... You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife. You think so, Frankie? Hell, you got steady work. Lawrence is getting derogatory again. Shhhhh, I'm concentrating! I think he's jealous of Havel. I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good. Amazing you made it this far. I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering. Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up. He doesn't gamble. I'll watch. Francoise - Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky. Marcus Aurelius has died. He left us at dawn. According to my nava-computer, the -- Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!! Sheriff, this is no time to panic. This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!! My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place -- Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me -- Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy. WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?! You have a name? Marty. Marty Lewis. Are you busy tomorrow night? No. Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay? Sure. And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz. Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm. Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you? Mother. Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else. You mean mistook <u>me</u>? Didn't I say that? Yes and no ... Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related? What? You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room. I could never move - I've got too much stuff. I was waiting for that jack. I had a feeling. I am become Death, the... ...destroyer of worlds. No! No!  You'll kill us all! Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there! It's too... So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein. Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it. Snap out of it, bomb. In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void. What have you done? I cut myself. Disappointed. She never told Eddie, though. She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past. How'd you manage that, then. When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look. Yeah, well, she started all that in London. Modelling. Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know. No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it. Like this? What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed? Wait. How about this? Now you're squinting like you need glasses. Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money? There are places. I'll scuffle around. Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive. Now, when did you adopt me? I don't know when it was. Thirty-seven! Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal. Bud--I thought you wanted to come home. Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ... I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ... Re-runs? Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud. Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ... Excuse me? Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow? BUD. Terrific. I'll talk to you then. Might at least have left me my pants! Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and... My very words. Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'. Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go... One false move and I'll blow your heads off! Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money -- And, what, I'm not serious? You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun -- Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun? Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't -- <u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is. River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden. I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk. Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley. The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena. That's right... . Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater. Mm hmm. You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future. Mm hmmm. They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks. A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted. Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition. I always figured I'd live longer without it. Maybe. I'm so close I can feel it. Me too. I'm almost there. That's it. I'm done. That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it? No, it was a complete waste of time. This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone. You plan to drink both those beers? Sorry. Lime.  Harry Lime. Okay. I thought he'd be here to meet me. Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed! Done poisoning the youth for the day? Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs. One seventy-nine. Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon? A half hour. We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high? I should start. Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man! With you? I don't think so. Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers. Nothing personal. She'll come back. No, she won't. Why would you let her to do that? It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me. You fucking bastard... Whose side are you on? The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation? Does he know how to activate it? Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button. I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves? Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why. What makes you so sure? I'd like to pay you for that laptop. It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector. That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted. Woody, stop it!! Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled! I'll inform dispatch. There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down. We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move. Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do. ...sorry... This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking! One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you -- Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us! What's wrong? I don't know who I am. What do you mean? You're Rita. I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!! Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back. I'd rather not... Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out. ...what're you saying? When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword. Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death? No.  Not <i>likely</i>. I'd be so nervous. This is not the finals -- just sing! It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal. That's my baby. He's gonna be awright. We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone. Maybe you should back off. This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did. You? You went by the book? Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya. That's where he's going. It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa. And destroy every planet in the system. You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you? I have this condition - I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason. Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it. No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend. Well, that seems a harmless fancy -- Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal. Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go. I know.  And nobody can make him. That's right. What? John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi. Good to know you, John. We're waiting. Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world? Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God? ...But what'd she do? What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did! My mouth is kinda dry. Then I'll get you some punch. I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around? Yes, but no, I can't right now. Why? No, don't! What the - We've fired on the Chancellor's ship - Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside. I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious. Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices? What happened to you? As in...? Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...? ...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision... Answer the question. Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved? None of your business. ...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday... What's the matter with you? Nothing. Why the bad temper? It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves. Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors. Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go! You okay, Jim? How do you feel? Young. I feel young, Doctor. ...Does he know? ...He does now... Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house. I guess it must. What do you do anyway? A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes. Where'd you learn to do that? From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman. A medicine man? Those are white words, not ours. Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good. Come here. Pulse, slow, very little pressure. Look at that right eye. Epidural hematoma? I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you? Not enough to be a pro. I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that? I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria. What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party. That is correct. To victory. I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman... More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery. Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs. No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you -- You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother. William. Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call. Seventeen meters. Let's get these things lit. What to the rebels want? Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air. Let her go. It's cool. Louis, the house is beautiful. I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor. What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!? What do you think? Great. Good afternoon, Mrs...? Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. Everything green on my boards, Skipper. Start the countdown. We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things. Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of. Aaarrrgggaahh. It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost. You're not lost. And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk? Colored. Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead? Sure-- Knock-knock. Who's there? John.  My name is John. It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt? I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful. Oh, God. I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have? Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore. Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it. Yes? Yeah, you would. Well, i-if-if you have some free time... Yeah, sure. Where do you live? I told you -- with my mother. Where does she live? A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx. All right -- I'll take you to the subway. Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab. Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx? You mean you bring other girls up here? Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man. Goodnight. Goodnight. Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint. You <U>are</U> a lunatic! Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts. C mon. Sorry, Jack.  It s too important to me. Okay, give me the keys. You bastard. It's either that or you drive to the police yourself. The police? C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there! She's not tied up! You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will. I am not! Then let's go talk to her. When do we go? Tonight. Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate. Where'd you get it? Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday. You stole it? I borrowed it. Hello. Saunders-- Hey, what kind of swag did you score? Yeah. Mall madness, huh? Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried. Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten! We have a radio like this, too. No, not like this one. And why wouldn't we have one like this? Because this is a Chinese radio. What if you hide me? What do you mean? Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning. You're looking fit. Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner? If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might. Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for. Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck. I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think? Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight. This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin? If I can smoke it. You want a muffin? Donna, you are a muffin. Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach. Got it. We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes. It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it - They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either. It helps if you don't think of them as human. Ever done anything like this before? Only minimum security. I see. What does that mean? It means... I see. You don't have to make this harder than it already is. I couldn't if I tried. The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on... You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years. I wouldn't wait if I were you. What do you mean? What's going on? The Head Man's writing a Bill. A Bill! Not *him*! The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply. That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away. He doesn't have anything to cut with. Lili!  No! Jack... Forgive me... Yes? We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk. Only a pig could do a thing like that. Watch your tongue, boy. Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that. There's still a big spot on the floor. Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece! Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic? Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float. I'm coming...How close is it? Close...I don't know...Just get the hell.... You wouldn t have a cigarette, would you? I don t smoke. If you could get to the point... Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish. Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew". Anyway, I guessed it right and won these. How do I look? You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are. Have another drink, Thelma. Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... The bathroom. I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall. Thank you, Mr. Bates. Norman Bates. The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion? It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally. When he dies I'll catch up. _ Your father raped someone? Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is? Yes. I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one. You're the killed. Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded. But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own. Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform. I'll go. You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry... Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it. What's wrong Mr. Lawford. It seems we're short on singers. I've got to get her out of here. -- go ahead. -- well aren't you -- -- what?  -- I'll see you later... -- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house. Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action? Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime? Is this you? No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh? Golly. Who's paying for this? That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. I know, I know. See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one. She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here. That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her? She dropped in on me... holding this. Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look. What do you want me to see? Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous. It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man. You take pictures and split.  I'm going in. Well? It looks....foreign. Jam is jam! It's just jam! ...and? They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here. NINJA CRANE ZORD! NINJA WOLF ZORD! Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there. But as much as they loved her... Oh, fabulous. ...they didn't know what really moved her. Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation. Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning. Relax.  We'll drop the song. Guess I got a little scattered. It's a shitty  song. This is Drake Bishop. <i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i> What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear. Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night. I don't think she's such hot stuff. When are we going out?  You and me? Not tonight. You going with Patrick? With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground- -true enough- but without the comedy relief. Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here. Yeah, we're here. The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York. No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation. You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on? I got to go.  I'm late. Call me tomorrow. There's other guys as good as me, Loomis. Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me. A couple of weeks. One question. What? Who is she? Why am I doing this? It's an experiment. God, I've missed you. And I you. Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? -- -- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that -- -- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? -- Yes, sir. All stop on the engine. Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'. No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me. Sorry I got you into trouble. I'll survive. What are you, a cop? If I see you do it again, I'll report it. I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you? Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that. So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy. You're talking about complicity. I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat. If you could, I'd   If I can. He gets jealous; he- I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done? Do you? Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property. Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master. So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard? Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long. If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long. My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell. Some mysteries should not have solutions. Hold your son high. Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him. He told you that? Yes sir. Are you sure? Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want. Allah will provide. We're just having a little drink. So I see. Whoa, my life is cool! Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago... Well, why not? Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks? I'd rather sing than do anything! It's better than ice cream. It's better than springtime. Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S. I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny. Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him. Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line. I want to stop aging. And I want Doucet. What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out. What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner? No, you're his wife. I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time? It don't look right. Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time. I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want. You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared. Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long. That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him. And you're drinking with them right now. And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong. Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look. He asked me to see were you all right. If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead. Yeah? You and what army? Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats. Well, if you must know, they could be closer. Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance. That's not it. No? What do you mean "bad news"? She's involved with these drug dealers. Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do. How can it be the right thing if we're not together? I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me. So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me! East coast people are different. Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt -- I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious. I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough? I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club. Would you know this store again? Sure.  Why? It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping. And she saw you? Yes, she did. So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal? You know how I felt about her. Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at. It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different. You find out? Yeah, I did. You stayed after all. Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry? I'm starving. Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? Is it about my teeth? Yes. Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon? I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem. I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train. Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man. Viktor, do you realize you always do that? Do what? Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit. I do? Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start. Excuse me?  Start? It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor. I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection. Not so loud. Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP. HEY! He's coming, Electra!  Get out now! Oh, God.  I see it! Actually, I'm free Sunday. Now. Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow. If we don't go now, it won't happen. Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you. Are you guys bruddas? Is this part of the act or are they really hurt? I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show. Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here? Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking. Well, it's a tricky turn. Eh, yes, ma'm. Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right? Oh yes. That's fine. Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery. I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said. It was you there? When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself. And, what did he say? He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize... What did he say, Katrina? I have not been able to face him yet. The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now. Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them. What would you have me believe? If you think I am behind this, say it. The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name. Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out. Think you can figure it out? I'll think of something. That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right. That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right? I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding. His journals, letters, maps, books... I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things. I was only reacting to what I was told. This is your desk set.  I don't get it. They gave me the exact same thing as last year! Oh.. Oh. What are you doing?! Knox?! Kelly.  What is it? I miss Dad. Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes... No you don't. He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married. Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker? Go on, beat it! A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee? Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow! Thanks for nothing, you bum. You okay, Miles? I'm good. But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now? You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice? It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes? I saw Karen Sisco. Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company. I'll be back when I can. STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT. I really hope you have a nice trip. Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too. Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it? Hmm. Good night. Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad. Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death. Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident... What do you mean?  Some noises where? In the house.  I was scared. Did you call the police? No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning. Of course. Yes, Cole? They used to hang people here. But they know. They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good -- They know. They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff. Except the money. And I congratulate you. What for? Your work. Thank you. I try. We all try. You succeed. How're the cameras doing? Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it. Nothing that we can do can make that woman well. And no one will know the truth. What is the truth? That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it. Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship. Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching. Good night. Good night. And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are. And what are they? The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality. There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior. His behavior... ? He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit... Look, where is he?! There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone... Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you... Now -- er -- Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness... Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet. Any luck? He's just around the corner. Why do you say that? Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she? The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override... Scan for lifesigns. There is nothing. Reach out farther. Call to her. Lyssa ... Lyssa ... You hear it again? No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back. You think he'd of shot us? When? Any time -- us -- Americans. OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it? Eleven fifteen. OK. Mark that down. I did. Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today. Jesus. Look out, damn it, I need that antidote! Who cares? Where's that diamond! All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go! I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire. Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go! Awful lot of money. Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen. You're the doctor.  sad news, friend. Damn!  All right, wait a minute... What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it. I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price? Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along? Yes. Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him. She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything. <u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it! It's my brother's neck you want, not mine. Yours will do! Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed. Is that good? Shut up! That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day. Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983. Oh - upstairs, quickly! Go on! A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories. I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord. Perhaps. If the pay is good. Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre! I'd use pills. They're painless. Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture? Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox. Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ... We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel. A window onto the human condition? I prefer to think of it as a mirror. It's for my daughter. How old is she? Four. Oh, she'll love it. What did you do? I'm always bad. What did you do? I breathed! I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch. Larry, you and your wife got problems? I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends. You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all. You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult. Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name? What's the dif -- Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They -- Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee. John? Mmmmm... I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were? How do you put up with this Greek shit? Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie... I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember? Come on. Tell me what you do know. [Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket. Well, what time is it? 2004. Ollie. What? It's your play. I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game. That's right. Isn't it a little late? Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning? I don't want land. Listen, Alice ... Herbert. Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get. But I don't like her. Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ... I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ... Thank you very much. Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now. No, nothing. Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed. Levene! Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed. Levene!! Oh my god.  You bought it. Yep. It's niiice. Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes? Absolutely. Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning? You got it. I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit! Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya. Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either. If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands. Speak for yourself. Don t they have a limit at those machines? Not if you take an advance on your credit card. Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering... The cockpit? What is it? It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes? How is everything? Everything's good.  Everything's fine. Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now. Here, you guys.  Open them up. Tina! N-o-o-o-o-o-o.... It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey --- No!  It's still there! What is it?  What's there? It's still there! I need a hand here.... Are you seeing Betty tonight? Nah. Now?! No...I know the perfect time... -- Find him? Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour... Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop? Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody. Dear heart, where are you? At the Hilton. The girls asleep? I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow? I don't think that's such a good idea. What are you doing with the Ivans? I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now. Is that funny? It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way. Why? Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then. It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by. I didn't have any. You had no inner feeling? None. Then I must have been supplying it. Just a moment.  Starling didn't... Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun... I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from... ...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..? But I'm going first... Anything you say, Mammacitta. Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized. If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about. Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl. How did you find out? I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town. Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her? Just find the girl. I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves. Avocado groves? We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross. Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here? Uh huh. I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool. Liverpool? What? Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end. Did you? We found him this morning. What's that next to him? His head.  Someone cut it off. Fine.. Learn anything? Oh yeah. Good. I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort. Yes, I will. By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall? I used to model for 'em, why? Just wondering. I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while -- -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles. Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain. I don't see the connection. The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car. That's ridiculous. Let him have his say out. What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer? More history, Rose. Are you going to get your degree soon? Well, I am working on my thesis. It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff. Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola? You're so sweet. There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think - You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles. Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone! Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean. And why's that? He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him. When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond? I don't take it, Sam. I give it. Stick out your hands, Jake. C'mon, Joey. G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy. None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy. Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet. You ever been in a hostage situation? Only at the very end. How do you feel after a shooting. Like it had to be done. Hey, you're good. Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are. That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who? Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'? Dylan, I was just asking Eric if-- Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back. You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan. You better not say you missed that. Missed what? It used to make me laugh, but. I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy. Yes. Frank-- Frank is coming? No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me. I sure don't hate you. I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong. That's good. Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil? Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn  As life's corners I . . . All right, let it go. . . . turn. No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune. Oh. Right. You have kids, Jack? Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones. Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know! I don't know... AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime. I'll nose around... You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing... What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism. You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka? Sloan and I have been looking all over for you. You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short? No offense. Manray needs a job. Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one? Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family. You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes. Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late? Uh, no. There's one...down here. Oh really? I didn't know that. I'll do it.  No more. Are you serious? Yeah ... I'm out. Is that the truth? I'll never run again.  I promise. No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day. Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me. I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life. I thought I told you to keep out! So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think? Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie. Eric, you're not watching your mouth! You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth! Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you! Help yourself prickfuck! I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole! Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now! Let it go, don't waste your time. Down here, Hooper! You wanna get caught spying on Albert? No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert. I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend. There was a message, wasn't there? It's probably easier for you to eat the rice. Marion!  What did you tell the police? Nothing about you. Then what? Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple. And him? Big Evil? We just keep him locked up forever? Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on -- I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous? Only around humans. What are you doing here? Get out. Leave him alone. You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out. Do they worry you that much, then? They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you. That's my business. No argument there. The guy's a fuckin' moron. Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick. Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'? Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash. Since when does... ...Darlene pay you in cash? Since today.  New policy.  Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.  Well, he told me to collect cash. Andy.  Another fuckin'... ...moron. Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. Uh, huh? Except for the fact that I need cash. He could've called first. He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart... ...and fair... ...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what. Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent... ...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love... ...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain. That'll make up the difference, huh? Huh? Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that. Oh. Why don't I--? No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight? Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that? Very good.  You're obviously mechanical. You're not from L.A., huh? New York. What motel you staying at? <u>Ho</u>tel. Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel? Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it. Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break. There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike. Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich? He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century. What's he been in? Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away. Is this Malkovich fellow appealing? Yes, of course. He's a celebrity. Good. We'll sell tickets. Tickets to Malkovich? Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop. But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it. Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me. You wanted to be partners with me? Sure. It'd be fun. Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence! I'll protect you, Dollface. What are you doing with the Ivans? I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now. Did he pay you for this? Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for. The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander? You can oc that? What is it? That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed... What're you getting at? If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own... Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye. The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts. You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters. I know of no better time. You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce. The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already. You must not act impetuously. It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us. But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life. My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her. No, I'll kill you. . Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls.. I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I? Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! I never signed the form. I did it for you. What! Shit! It's what you wanted isn't it? Yes ... No ... I don't, know. Well, look who's here! Hello, dear. Hello, darling. Ahhh, ahhh... Now what? Gotta sneeze. Don't you dare. Can't help it... ahh... We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home. Why would I let you do that? I know where the money is. If you knew, you would have it with you. I need dark. To get it. I know where it is. I know something better. What's that. I know where it's going to be. And where is that. It will be brought to me and placed at my feet. Mara -- what -- ?! Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- ! ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women. There's a slight difference. Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever. What's her problem? She has no real grip on reality. Does anybody? Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together. And what does Jennifer think's real? It's Church. I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered. Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty. We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir. We're through running from these bastards. Halina? What? Funny time to say this. What? wish I knew you better. Thanks. There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible. How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it? Don't get smart with me, son. Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage. That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit. Thank you, Sir. Mama, why did they take Daddy away? Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child. Is he gon' be gone long? Might be... -- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode! You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- ! You've created a monster. Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive. History. Huh? My father proposed to my mother in there. No kidding? Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups... Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you? I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...? I don't...yes.  Okay, the board. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any... What?  You can't do any what? APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about? Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories. Not again. I adjusted it. ...long overdue. Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America. Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation. That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?! Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me. Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality. The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew? I don't control minds. I free them. That was a loud one wasn't it? After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it. And number three, Dolly. Uh... two shooters! Fan-fuckin-tastic! When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid? Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff I paid for those guitar cases. Yeah. I'd have to bleach my hair. Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee. How tall are you? -- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party. Well -- at the moment, that'd be me. And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room. A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room! -- and we are sure... I axed you a question. Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking. You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl? What's with you two? Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle. Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred -- -- You know his name is Frank. Is he here? You know I don't live with him. Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp -- Are you finished? In a couple of days this whole thing -- Who's looking for you? Go now. WHAAAATT? Don't forget to set the alarm. Why can't you talk to me? I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act... I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too. Well, I had a good time up to a point. Wesley can be very entertaining. Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table -- It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain. But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him. I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation. Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is. I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother. Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther. All the bears gonna be walking today. You said that last year, Dad. The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we. So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big pi ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em. A pi ata. That's a <u>great</u> idea! What did you just say? I said she's been missing for- No. No you said HER BODY's been missing. What's the difference? Did you hear that? Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood. I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures. Of course. Goddamnit!  Goddamnit! There has to be something that we can do. -- open circuit breakers -- -- remove thrust drive repellant -- -- automatic channels open -- -- Remark. 5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop! After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business? Do you miss it? It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years -- Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone. EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid. Good to see you're feeling better. Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"? It's about the Director. Again? If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you? No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go. You'll miss the battle of the century! Good. My heart can't take it. Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one. Are you asleep? Yes.  Dropping off. Did... you... get... him? Yeah. What's happening?  Am I needed? I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him. Who? I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out. But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help. In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers. Please, call me Gale. Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok? Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go! Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer. It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful. You don't really think so? I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something? Please, Mr. Bernstein. Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful? Look, if you want to die do it yourself! No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share. Now where are you going? Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will. Natalya? Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation. She married a hockey player. I envy your 'undercover' assignments. We work in the dark. We do what we can. We shall want a full autopsy ... With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas. Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece. How long have you been setting up? About 22 hours on site. Nice work. None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it? What is that supposed to mean? Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool. You want me out...  is that what you're saying? No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in. Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that. Why not?  Don't you think you could be? No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right? Er  No. No?  What do you mean 'no'? No. Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman. First, I have fun. But Ted, you're the only... I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before. You told em? You told em it's me? They already know it's you. Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it! Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You. Didja tell 'em anything else? I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here. Well, we'll see you later, Bob. Pleasure to meet you, John. Nice to meet you. Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again. You kiss by the book. He hates me. You hate him? Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it. You broke it? You know the source? Practically. You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet. I'm so glad you're here. I understand. Hi sweetie. Hi baby. Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring. This isn't just a mood ring. Does it work? Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine. Boyfriend? Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch. Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us. Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke. Whoa!  What the hell was that?! Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses! We're due to take off. Not for seven more minutes. I see it Chewie, hang on. The entrance is collapsing! What in God's name are you doing? Baack! What? Baack! What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs? The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles. Why they gotta make my nose so big? Look at my lips. Rangers. Go. EXT. DAM - DAY. And what are those? Small versions of adults, honey. What do you mean, no? The kid said -- Make them go faster, Mr.... ? No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then. Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses! Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself. What's that, sir? Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West. Anybody can see that. You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains. But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't. No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone. But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one? Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness. Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked. Tucker? Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you. What color are my shoes? You have feet? Nobody seems to want to do anything   Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what? About what? Your marriage to Anne! Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all. I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it. Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here. Did you sleep well? Yes, thank you. You should watch what you eat. Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar? I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds. And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck? Who you calling dumb, dickless? That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie. I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that. A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person. He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes. Who? Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should. I was hoping you could tell me. You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I. I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole. Where? In your operation. I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel. We haven't got a lead... Why not? They took 'em... Everything okay? A man killed in Central Park. Where did you learn it? Taiwan. Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it. Thank you. I've always wanted to learn something like that. You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it. So this Z...he fancies himself an individual? Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir. Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you? Oh, no, sir! Good.  You're a good soldier. Thank you, sir. Do you guys feel like painting? What color? Red. I love red!  That's my favorite color! Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag. No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM! That does sound lucky. It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling. Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic. I'm going out the front. Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart. You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain. You say that like it's a bad thing. That's too bad. What? Nothing.  Is that the kitchen? That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here - Gregory     you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight. It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest. What is it? The air's stopped. What happened to the two Clays, Willie? Out. When they coming in? Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack. Jesus. What? That's the <u>reason</u>. Get some sleep. You have to sleep for three. Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em. It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along. With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince. And you? I just work for the travel firm. I'm leaving, too. But, Eve, I would-- And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous! What's Emergency Landing Plan B? I don't have a clue. What? What? He's here. Shit! It's going to be a cozy weekend. What is? We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I... Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects... I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if... No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks. How are you?  Here.  Get under this. Thanks...  we're taking your cab. Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here-- --but you're father's in there! Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do-- I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee. That's very nice of you. Thank you. Yes. I... It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company... They'll know when you go over to Graff... What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case. You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail! I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John. Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson. Do you have a ticket? You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson. You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him. Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those? Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids? Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive. Cheap, cheap, cheap. They smell. Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell. They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell. Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell. They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous. The what? The Cretaceous. Anything else, you old fossil? Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk! It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now! I could kill that no good son of a bitch! All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this! Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls. Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth... Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is! Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is! What are you doing up here then? Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over. You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died? Every day. I wonder about that every day... Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars? Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer? Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down? The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness... Righteousness... Righteousness for his namesake. Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say... Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you! Get yourself a glass. No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home. Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield. That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids? Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet! How you holding up? I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself. Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive. Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why? If you want to tell me. Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive! Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong. If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are. Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors. I'll say as little as possible. Not bad for government work.  Having a good time. Haven't had so much fun since Live TV. You will find them when you find sivlalinga. I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here. I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean. Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it. I'm not the same person you remember. Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it. I know you believe that. ...Don't you? I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense? Cut. What are you doing that for? Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right? That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world. Do you have any kids? No. Although I've studied them in the wild. Gee, I always loved porch swings. Me too. That's why I put this one up. I never said that! Bird. That's jazz. You said you weren't coming? I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen. What did you find? Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body. How was it contracted? That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat. ... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith. I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side. And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you? I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe. Spoken like a true believer. What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all? How do you mean? Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations. My father's house has many mansions. Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small. George... Yeah, baby... You're a genius. Who cares? I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge? Frogs? Lingerie. Yeah?  So? No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp. Oh my dear child. God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said... Who? Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen. Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead. But she watches... she listens. Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat. I'm not hungry. You've got to eat something Agnes. No I don't... the host is enough. My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything. Of God. Yes, of God. It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception. And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception? You are so damn sexy. Vince... How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank? Today was the deadline, Vince. Amen! Amen! She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men. It's important. If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway. Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad. I think we better go home. Don't panic, Anthony. I'm not. But there's -- You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to -- Our money situation is not good. You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred -- We've got sixteen dollars. That's not correct. Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged? I do. Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?... Do we have to listen to this shit? Yes. Why'd we have to leave so fast? You have any idea what a shirt like this costs? Nice things cost money. I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent. We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money. Pardon me? Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile. What's the profile? Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range? You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this. Don't let your father's business infect your life. How can you, how can you say that? Because he's guilty. No, no he's not. We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship. Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother. How was your plane ride? The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away. This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television. Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i> We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark. Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you ! What ? You took an awful big risk back there. Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me. If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here. I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW ! Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ? NO ! I wouldn't do that. Then he isn't embezzling either is he ? Why would he ? His parents are rich. That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain. Anything else you want to tell me? Harold? Huh? You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends? No. None at all? Well, maybe one. Would you care to talk about this friend? No. Is this a friend you had when you were away at school? No. I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold? Yes. You liked your teachers? Yes. Your classmates? Yes. Your studies? Yes. Then why did you leave? I burnt down the Chemistry building. Why is he in the basement? He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left. Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get? What's to see? What's on the ClockCam? A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering -- What do you want with us? I demand -- Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore. I beg your pardon? Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe-- I am <u>not</u> staying on shore. It's too dangerous for-- I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows-- You flew up here because your boss-- I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of-- Hey, how ya doin'? Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these. What are they? To help you relax... please... To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge. We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in. Oh, dear. What's the matter? I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so. I'll go search for it. Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you. I'm not its master. The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone. Your command is my wish, Princess Lili. I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz. First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King. Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees. Makes me want to hold on and never let go. I love you. I love you. Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out? Stressed? He's psycho. Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah. The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive. Hello? Hi.  It's Frank. Hi, Frank. I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow. Yes -- she did. Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine. No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea. This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry. I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way... Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to. I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down. Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs. Egg. One egg doughnuts black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints? Nope. No complaints. I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint. Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this. What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning? Must be the Spring. I thought maybe uh "believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories. He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married. Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut? Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything. No. No. It's too good a story. Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man! Yeah? It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken. Um. You're doing all right. Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun. One consolation; you can never be lonesome. It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it? Santa Claus? King King Westley was in it. Oh. Is that how you met him? Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school? Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk. Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it. Thanks, professor. Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk. I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day. The ropes are coming loose. Be careful! I am--It's our only chance. Nothing is worth your life. My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway. I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened. Hold on just a little longer, Shirley. Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it. You do? Yes I feel it in my bones. You're talking nonsense. Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us. They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b> I should hope not.  I hate you! That sudden? Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault. ...And I thought you loved me. I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one! Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can. A full night on the street and this is all? Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score. Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money? Oh, sure. Cause if you get in a bind-- No, no. Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad-- Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not-- -- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both... I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday. Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city. Did she tell you where she was callin' from? No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift. How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay? Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad... What? I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then. Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail. No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport. I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it. Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it. You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right? Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords? Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right? No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember. Why would anyone do something like this? What's that? Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh? No.  Here. Separate incidents? Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that. Okay. Good night, beautiful. Night, Josh. Do you intend to enlist without my permission? Yes. Eighth room down, babe... Guards come exactly every three minutes.... Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. See!  See, I told you. Get that, will you? Why do I always have to answer the phone? Because you're the closest. I'm not any closer than you are. Shouldn't you be lying down, or... I'm alright.  But you can sit. I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL. Yup. What are the doctors saying? A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months. I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve. Not for Quincy McCall. I forgot, "Q-man. OH MY GAWD! I'm sorry - I didn't think A person could get killed round here just for working late He's telling the truth. He doesn't know. Should I kill him now? Wait. Any last words, General Lee? Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it. I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- - --you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight! The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time. Why? Just let me know when you are going out and where -- What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic. How can you do it to yourself? I don't get you. Ligourin: How could you do it? I told you before, you wouldn't understand. You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women. No. No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it? Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk! No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to -- You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out! Mattie.  What about this? I need it. Least you admit it. Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night. Look, Mattie, I know you're- You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman? No, no...It's too dangerous.... Mommy lets me.... Excuse me? I said take off your fucking shirt. Had no choice...  ...Given the situation. I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them. You're a fool.  Now put her back. I'm not going to let this baby die. Hello? You little sleaze bag! ...Ma??? Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands! I always hated this song. Yeah. What? This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill. What if I have a previous engagement? Break it. I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie. You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you. Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together... It's undamaged? Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape. So you can use it now? Yes... I suppose so. Go back to your own time? I could... What about Carter? Tight. But I'm working on him. Lean on him. It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives. Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del? That is a skill! Somebody paying you to do this? She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?! You can't-. Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know. But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us. And when you finally get Two-Face? Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much. Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going. It's a stretch but I'll manage. The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be... To kill me. You understand obsession better than you let on. No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up. That's usually my line. Look, I'd love to keep chatting- Would you? I'm not so sure. But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes. Excuse me. And into a black dress. -- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there... Didn't you have any panties on? -- He reached up and tore them. What did you do? Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was. No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time? No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything. You liked Sister Paul? She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful. What else did she tell you? She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know. Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town... We goin' in? Gun out and up. Sorry. What did you do to them? It's not what you think. How young? Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were. Looking for intelligent life? Looking for something -- someone. Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide. I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go. Why? Because I believe in something. Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'. Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose. I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house. Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative. All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension. I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out. Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do. Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home. You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out. It must be on the other side of this. But how did the wall get here? I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either. My home. There is one more thing, John. Here. Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares.... It could have been an accident.... It was no accident.... I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities.... When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming.... ...Well, I've got a large family. How many kids do you have? Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children. Eight children! No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. That's amazing. There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure. Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know... A jerk. <u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so... It's ten after nine. Yes, well...  famished. Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing... She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points. Think she means for us to follow? How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife! Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely? I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop. Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre. I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending. Me too. What about Luther? What about Ganz? What are you guys doin'? Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin". You want some company? Sure. Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there s space enough for war games... Must be good for business. Must it? All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps? Ain t nobody out there, Mister. Nobody? Huh!... How come? Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum... Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says  closed to the public , doesn t it? You a tourist? Please. Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations. I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career. You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family. Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness. Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story. About you and Li Mu Bai? Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married? No, really? His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it. Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's. I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties. Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters. Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage. You want me to check? I said good call. You got that shit right. What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand. You're just on a higher plane, Wilson. Too bleeding true, 'n' it. Come on out a minute, okay? Okay. Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve? Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic. Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think. That was our assessment as well. Where did this come from? My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription? Satisfied? Open the bag, dump everything on the table. How do you do, Skye? Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are. Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends. When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual... I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director. Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... Why are they ... That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus.... At least you still have the tapes. Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out. Yes, Jabez -- don't worry. WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT. Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"? Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...? That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building? You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you? All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em. You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'. A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long. Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me. This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures... But it's comfortable. Why don't you try sitting up? Or you could try lying down. You're in quite a mood today. Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve- I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours... I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is. Can I quote you? The sign of our partnership. Brought us luck once, maybe it will again. Hey. That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good. Hey!! Satellite feed. Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then. We're slowing down.  This must be it. End of the line. You've been a good friend, James Carter. Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton. You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy. Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it. Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues... And? And now the job's yours. Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.- Young love. So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans? I've got my Seahaven Bankcard. So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this. Spock... don't. It's all right, Captain.  Proceed. Sleep okay? Yeah. You? Where are you going? Head hunting. Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss... What I think is going on with your son. Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher. We were just trying to push the envelope -- You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again. What year are you in? I'm what you would call a fifth year senior. But I thought high school is only four years. It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself. Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside? I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton. This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal? My mission is to protect you. Yeah?  Who sent you? You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time. I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand? Yes sir. That was good. He heard everything we were saying. Do you play? No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you? Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument. What do you want? I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me. Do you work for her now? Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing. Me, too. Randy. Me too. Well I guess... Yeah... Bedtime. Escape hatch. Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted... No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove. There! You see! It could have been anything, Marty. What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you? No. I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often. Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it. I thank you. You're welcome. Everyhing go off all right? Fine...  I want to talk to you. What about? Doreen. Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. That reminds me, I gotta take a shit. You gonna wipe your ass dis time? Yeah if you let me have your shirt. ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy. Sorry, I just didn't remember. I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world. Yeah. Good bye. No -- actually I'm not -- I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte -- You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well??? Well what? What do you want? What do I want? What do you want? Any more MiGs? Well? God, you're beautiful. Please. I look a mess. No. You look so beautiful. Anyway. Come already to the point. I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you. I've moved on. No! I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry. That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?! That's not how he tells it. Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle. Hunh. Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary. You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig? I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War. Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that? I said - I suspect the Secretary of War. THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms -- But - You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh? He must have left another puzzle piece. Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh... This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday. No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said -- -- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong. But Richard, no, I, I -- -- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis? Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK? Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it? Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base? Look, if William Morris doesn't come through - Adrian. Laurie!  Good to see you. What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life? Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here... All right.  What is it? A square? Good guess -- but no. Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw? I'm staying with the Countess. I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York? I don't. You don't? Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving. Get the broom. I ain't getting shit. Why? I don't want blood on them. Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing? Strip! Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it! Annie, I think we should have a toast. A toast? Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine. That's good. Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all. I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them. Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider. Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you... I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business. Don't make it less true. Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere. No it's okay, I understand, really. Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada. So, what's the story with your friend? My friend has lost her fucking mind... What's she doing? Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now. I'll tell OR we're bringing - He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down! You want to talk about it? What's the point? It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki... You're beautiful. So are you! I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish! Saunders--! And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted! Are you drunk? Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot. You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory. Huh? Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book. I'm having luck for the first time in my life. Your bank, Mr. Kringelein. Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us! What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore. Oh! Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste. You can't make it. Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today. Yep. But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?! Yeah it's the biggest disappointment! Finnegan, what the hell was that? I don't know...you got what we need? If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe? There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them? Six. How many wings have they got between them? Twelve. How many feet? Er, well, twelve. That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got? How the fuck should I know? How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?] Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there? Lucky, I guess. That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture? Uh huh. It looks so soft. Your compliment was sufficient Luis. All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand. Let it go. There. I beg your pardon? There wolf!  There castle! Why are you talking like that? I thought you wanted to. No. I'm all excited -- Me, too. I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was -- Like a marriage made in heaven? You have a way with words. What's the delay? Let's move your ass in there!! Corpses? Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland. In the highlands? You're not interested in seeing how it looks. Oh, I am.  Later.. I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux. Do it.  Do it. And, I'm sorry, who are you again? Frieda's boss. Who's Frieda? My secretary. John, throw me the keys. What for? The trunk.  It's locked. It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body. It's . . . it's locked. You closed it, didn't you, Grace? I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up. Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here. No.  I swear it. And you're not one to lie, are you? Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up. Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck? Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He-- Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman? He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost. Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me... You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this! Well done. Thank you. Now, where were we? More fun win battle? This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress. You go to lady now? To finish last evening's delightful work. Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you? I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me... What do you mean, you're not sure?! Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you... Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree... Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard. So? What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment? You've misunderstood. I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment. And don't start crying. I'm not crying. See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you. Not according to the men in blue. What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states. They want to discredit you -- for what? For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth. You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why. You know my work? Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government -- I don't either, but it sure sells books. If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit? How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me. Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece? I'm ready! Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake. Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced. Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg. Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning. Where's the five? In your other hand. How could you do this to me? I'm in love with you. Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that? Eight hundred, give or take. Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them. So tell me about you and the Chancellor. What's to tell? Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth... I hope you'll be gentle. Think about mom. I did. Objection. Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant. It's not ignorant. But how can it change every time? It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible. No...you...go...ahead. Okay. Hello? I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny? They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies! You're sure... Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message. Okay, Ken. We're going. Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major. Champagne and a tin of caviar. May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine. Thank you. Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad! Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology. Braddock -- Braddock? Yes, but I'm afraid -- I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff. No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend. I'm afraid I don't understand. I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry. Hey -- I don't get it. I'm sorry? I don't get it. You did last night. It's all right. He don't mean anything by that. I don't, huh? Harry, can you tell me about the sphere? What are you still doing here? You remember opening the door? You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here. Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry? You don't understand about the sphere. Then explain it to me. I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck. With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip. And what of the Eloi? They survived above.  Became what they are. No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that. I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now. But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of -- And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact. It can't all be like this... I'll remove him. Fuck you! I'll remove myself! Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure? It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school. Wow just like Marco Polo. I don't follow. You know Mom, like in the pool. You mean that? What? ... The bodies out the door. I want him to think that. But do you mean it? What? Why she kills children. And what do you do, my dear? I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain. How interesting. Not very. Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do? I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine. Why didn't you tell me? I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around? Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus. Something wrong with that? I was just thinking of... the noise. I like the noise. Is there someplace we can talk? How about the Rainbow Room? This... is the number one single? Yes, sir! I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll? I beg your pardon? This is 1952....? Uh, yes, sir... And you never heard of rock 'n roll? No.... You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton. You didn't, Jimmy. I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume. You only embarrass yourself. Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again? You know what I mean.  Your reputation. But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air. Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that? No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent. I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious. I agree. Let's have a look, do you mind? Of course. I would like to look. Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me. But there's no one here, darling. She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there. Oh my God...! What happened? I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca! Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh? We found some bodies -- let's get out a here. Yes, I'm ready now. Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times. I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on. Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office... You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over. She has hostages. What's the matter? My <u>tail</u> itches. FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT! WE'RE OUTTA HERE! I won't wear your stuff.  I promise. Not you, Donna, not you. The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands. Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir! Will I believe you when you tell me something? There's nothing left for me to lie about. Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure. I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens. I doubt that. Why? Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change. Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard. What's he like? David Lee... Yes, sir... You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow. I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none. You learnin' anything at that school? Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot-- Slash what? Sexual surrogate... slash... companion. A doll? No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies. Why not? I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country. But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses. No, I don't think so. For heaven's sake, why not? I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade. No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors! Yeah? How old are your kids? My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon? That's because he doesn't have one. Whata you mean?  He told me - Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is. What's to stop him from just ripping me off then? That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme. Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period. I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring. What time is it? Two thirty. I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in! I'm taking up the situation with you now... Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world. -- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening! Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there? Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth. What are you talking about? Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison. A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?! _Answer_ me. We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill... Why is she bringing that bag? She's going to cook something for us? Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks. Ssh!  I can't hear Gino! Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together? Because that would be too easy. I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she? I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care. That I will indeed. Find a chaplain. ...alright, let me know when. The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him. We need a warrant. We have probable cause now. This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen. I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today. I don't know -- Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen. Do you love him? I like him a lot. Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags. What is that? I don't know. Well, why don't you share them with us? I don't...I don't want to bother everyone. That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered. I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you. No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry. How did you get in? The stairs from the street. Don Giovannnnnnnni! Who the devil are you? What do you want? I've come to dinnnnnner! Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height. Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio! I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave. You can't help me, man. Freddie, do you have something to say? What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else. I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso. Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you. Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin. The girls like it loud. Girls?  You call those skanks girls?! You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around. For how long?  And why? Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him. Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow -- And they're changing into... I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds -- Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long? At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks -- What do you mean "complete"? I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and -- Weren't we supposed to? Oh... I feel a little... oh... Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open? When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open! Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell. It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle? Mr. Welles certainly is a caution Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down. And attractive in a hammy sort of way. Mm. You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight. What...?  What if I say no? Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country. Why me? They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you. Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you. I know. If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned. I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence. If you want company... Just check out the car. Yeah but, what is it? I don't know, they didn't speak too good English. How long is this going to take? We have a few more minutes. I mean, when will I be normal. We have a lot of work to do. Will I ever be normal? I couldn't say. You couldn't say. I'm afraid not. Do you know what "normal" is? I suppose it's however society defines it. How do you define it? I don't. Then how do you know if your patients are getting better? They usually tell me. How do they know? What is your idea of being normal? What is your idea of being a Jew? Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday. I want to be normal! Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal! Fuck you, Rosen! I know -- You don't know! I know you're frustrated, Walter, but -- This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work. David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud. I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN. Terry!  You okay? Help!  Help! Okay, okay, coming.... Balefire on you, Selena! You Scorpios can never take a joke. Bobby... I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone... Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two... Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...? Yes. Huh.  And why is that? Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway... You are a monster, Zorg! I know... Pick you up Friday, then Oh, right.  Friday. You alright? Kristen... That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him? It wouldn't come. Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her. Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna  - Good.  Good.  That's terrific... What? If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up. They both look good to me. You have no taste. What the hell did you think you were doing? You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name? How about Richard Grayson, college student? ...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him! We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school. I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own. Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad. It doesn't matter. Nonsense!  Course it matters. ... the Princess Lili... I've killed her. This is intolerable! This could be close. When will you be going? Not long... A few days. Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home. Of course, dear. You're home now. I'm home now. In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me. That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady? I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware. ...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it? ...Yeah, okay. Ready... wrestle! Knowledge I wouldn't want. No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen. This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? Kinship. Kinship. And what's here? Unless I miss my bet... my wife. M-m-m-ma'am? Would you like to start? N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am. Mister Sefelt? God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself? Difficult.  I'm difficult. What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great. Great. While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five. Marcus Aurelius has died. He left us at dawn. Watch it!  Move back. Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away. Well, you did all a body could, Ethan. I got your boy killed. Don't go blamin' yourself... You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for. Really? I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon? Sure -- I guess. Terrific. Those assholes. The poor girl's out of a job. Yeah...  I should give her a call. I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life. I'm afraid of being lonely. Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away. Actually, I don't make friends easily. What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid. So?  What's the problem? It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that. Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and... Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about? Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir. Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know? My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches. JOINT action? Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar... When can I see you? I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building. You're very kind... And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. Smith, get out of there... Come again, Skipper? One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark. Mary, I'm going home. Are you? When? In a day or so, I think. I don't blame you. Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over. Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage. So what brings you out tonight? Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing. How can you tell it's a female? ... The way she moves. I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club. I'm leaving you Jake. Sure, what else is new? No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out. Jack. Your doorbell doesn't work. Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack. Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France. The Scots will fight for us? What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve. But if we have not caught Wallace -- He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower? C'mon, Michael.  I want to go. No.  Stick around. Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy. Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister? Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here. But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes -- We can light our own tree at home. What hit me? That last Martini. Your mother wants to hear from you -- GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. I can live with those reflections. I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame. Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that. But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed. What is it? Kambucha mushroom tea... Jody-- It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring-- You're discussing me with your psychic? She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit. Thanks, but I'm fine. So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different? Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy. Yeah. What can I do for you? Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us. Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen. That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying. How long do I have? Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid. Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close. Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane. All right. Well what about the new Echo -- Do not get ahead of yourself. You ever been married, Hanna? Of course.  I am married still. Yeah?  What's your husband do? He is dead now, twenty years. Then you're as single as I am. No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad. You're sure of that? This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven. Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those. No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame? Are you the star of this picture? You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight. The other girl is the star? She thinks so.  What do you do? I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together. Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more. Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water. Thank you. Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists. Goodbye, Dr. Thurman. Goodbye, Donald. Isn't it illegal to drink and drive? That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me? ... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac. No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight- Jesus, God! Oh man, what the hell happened? And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook? I guess I...uh...regressed. In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation. With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we? No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection. Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting? I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me. I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you. Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me. How bad is it? Nothing for you to worry about, darling Pops Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he? Nice. Boys, we're home free. Thank you. We'll see you next week, and if-- Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it. Who's driving the boat? Nobody. We're drifting with the current. You're going to say it, aren't you? Tell him you love him.  With all your heart. I'm taking my next book to Viking. Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it. I'm moving this book to Viking. Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing. Needing. To belong to someone. Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer. How's Bugsy doin'? Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job. It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves. Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer. Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night? Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests. Did you win? We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me. Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night. Those newspaper people? You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots. What a gruesome proof of the power of the press! Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"! Oh, Leon! Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past! Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid? I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million! Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments! Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job. What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand. Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus. Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and-- I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year. Were they pen pals? No. Is he some kind of celebrity or something? No. Did he do some anonymous good deed for her? What are you doing? Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----. You look a little shaken. I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now... Last night? What do you mean? A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening? I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's? No, I have my things in the car. Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better. I'm in position, Scarecrow. Any activity? Not at all. The place is totally deserted. Good. It's supposed to be. I've got a great view up here. I can see all the -- Stand by, Bird Dog. What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble? No, it's nothin'... I'm all right. Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy. I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up? I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right. Okay... Lemme clear it with... It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go. Sure. You boys want anything? Yeah, bring us four fernet. Four fernet. Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We... I told you we had other stops to make tonight. You said you were visiting friends! They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead. Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks. Tonight it is. You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this... That's a nice shirt. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Where's this "reactor" come from? Aliens built it. Aliens?! Sure! No. I'm serious about this. Sure you're okay to drive this? This rig? Phht.  No problem. So I'll see you this weekend. Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends. I haven't done anything. I want you out of town before the hanging. I'll be long gone. You got the will in there, don't ya? No, I don't. You tricked me, damn you! Take it easy. There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with! Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter. Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland. How do you do, Mr. Leland? Are they standing for me? I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher - Ask them to sit down. You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations. I don't my plans myself. So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein. Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it. I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on. But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why? You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan. I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why? Why Jack? Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end... It's nice that they're still friends. Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men... Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter. They're withholding payment. Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days. Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt? Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's. The trees, eh... Well... it started with the play before this one... Remembrance'. Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger. Hey, that was last year. What's the matter, Sugar? I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty. What about you? I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over? I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio. Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you. Szpilman. Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist. You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off? No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime - Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love. We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat. Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat. Who cares? Who cares? Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass! Come on. One more time. Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts. Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it? Hmm. Good night. Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they? I feel like they do. Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention. Are you sure this is Bailey Park? Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses? Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore. Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand. Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today. Right. Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order... Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you? I've never seen you in here before. That's because I've never been here before. I'm Sylvia. What's your name? Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate. I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today. I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well... Too demure? I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence. Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming... WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING? DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT? NO. NO GOOD. Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all -- 60 years ago. Wha'? When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it. That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich? Do you, Mr. Leland? Certainly not. POP! That was My card! But... I had a five... You're hitting for MY cards! Why not? Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time. What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you -- Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma? Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone. Him no white.  Him no white. Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea? Sure. I'd like that. Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense! Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it. <u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?! I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks. Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you? What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it! That's not to tough. Look... Shit. You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us. I need to talk to you. That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp. I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is. Well then. I'd better show you. Terry -- It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future. Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way... And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger? Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash. Spray and Wash. That's the one. Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something. I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding? C'mon guys, settle down -- Cynthia? What? How much time do we have? Not enough, what do you want? I should maybe go to the bathroom. Can you hold it? I don't know. Just hold it, you'll be fine. I'm sick with practicing, that's it... I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything. Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise. Huh? That's smart! I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music. Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living? ...Composer. Huh, that's good! Yeah, but he's not exactly my father... Huh? ...No... he's my lover... What is it? I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers. It worked!  There they go! LET'S DO IT! What? How long have you been standing there? Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade? Fuck you, bitch! See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it... Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh... Parry. Parry... I'm Jack. I know... Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read? You did not ask me. I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me? Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me. We do have a lot to talk about, don't we? You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you. You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out. Me too.  For the most part. Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing. But he's a policeman -- He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark? For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!! They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!! Jabez -- will you join our Grange now? Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could. We'll be mighty glad to have you with us. Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off! Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job... Randy, c'mon! Have a good night. Everyday. I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds. Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens! From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions! Taylor -- quit riding him. You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree. Where you coming from? All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas. You've been around. I guess I've got wander in my blood. Where you headed? I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there. So, what is it you do, Mister...? Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... . I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances. If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes. What happens when you lose? I pack up and go somewhere else. What's that? Devil book. The Unix Bible. Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..? Sure. Go away -- please. That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks -- I can never get a way from it. Old ties are hard to cut. No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble. No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense. Mary, people come to him voluntarily. I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book. The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased. Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo! Mary... please. This is hurting people. Fifty calibers, eh, Captain -- As I said, we can pay you in gold. Entirely unnecessary, Captain. Does Mr Gluck call for his messages? Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir. Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that? Got it. Puppies. He is a behemoth. A diseased monster. Jesus... Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge. We can't do that, Bobby. You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me. What the hell's the matter with you? ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam... What? Palace? Hardly. Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City... Hello? Hey, Murph. Roc. You okay? Yeah. Anybody call for me? No. You sure you're okay? I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side. I can't hold the weight of both of you! Hush! Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable -- Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like -- I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there. You feeling any better? A little bit. Guess what. What? Your grandfather's here. Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick? You are sick, that's why he's here. He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that. Maybe he won't. He peed on the Dude's rug-- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude. If we hold firm, it won't be the last. Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think -- Remember him? He was a bit proud as I recall. He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning. He turned out all right. Who are you? That's not the way we play the game. I don't play games. What if your life depended on it? YOU HURT ME. I WILL PROTECT YOU. Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland. Where ya headed? What's- It's me, open up. Oh. Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What- There's a spider in the bathroom. What? There's a big black spider in the bathroom. That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom? My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects. Oooh. I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom. Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house? No. There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight. Deal. Talia, don't go! Wha-at?  What is it? Everything. Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god... It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay. This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use. She wasn't part of the deal, Cox. Fine    you want to stay here? We appreciate your help with this. So what's the deal? Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book. My name's Sophia. Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John. It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it. Yes, by all means. We must try it. -- we are both sure that's what we want? Absolutely. Let's get the hell outta here. Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages? Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle. Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie? In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc. Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn. Oh yeah. You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post? Sure I know Maya. Real well. No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her. What is with you? Excuse me? I'm going to spend <u>money</u>. I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place. I love you, too. Now she tells me. Hello, Jane. It s me. Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of... Carlos De Moraes? Yes. How did... Thank you, Jane. Father? Six-pounders.  Lots of them. Detective, does it look like a murder? We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done. How many victims are up there? There are two bodies found at this point. Can we go up to the crime scene? You know you can't do that.  C'mon. Is it drug related? We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know. Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you. It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...? Sure. Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...? Which... Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,, Uh... Home... Home cooking... The monthly interview...? Oh!  For the magazine... Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab... Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky. Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera. Howdy, Rhonda. You're really leaving, huh? You bet.  You gonna be staying up here? Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up. It's the FBI.  He wants to come in. Have him walk in backwards. Who was that?... Who know's your here? I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number? Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ... I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think? What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon. I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir. I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre. Really, I feel fine, sir. Farewell, Concorde! It just seems silly ... me lying here. Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene... I know.  It sucks.  I suck. So you ever gonna do a picture? Not you too It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great. I wonder sometimes. You're just scared. Am I? I don't believe it.  He's clean! What?  But I saw 'em- I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him. Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone? I don't know.  I'm sorry... You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think? What are you working on? Just a little experiment. He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it. It's not your fault, Dad. Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse. No. Captain Miller, you copy? I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark? I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time. We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air. Understood. Hello. Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this -- Benjamin? Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party -- Where are you? -- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something -- Where are you? Uh -- The Taft Hotel. Did you get a room? No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather -- Give me an hour. What? I'll be there in an hour. You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back? Stop it -- I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything. I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you? Nothing that won't heal.  I guess. Houdini's sick. Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight. ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed. Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance. What do you think? A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus. That would be my guess. Your guess? It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks! What's with him? And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs. What's he called? Canelo! Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird... Haven't heard a bird sing in days... Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work -- Door to the right. Get up and run. I can't see a thing. Neither can they. There must be a phone around here somewhere. A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson. Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you. Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions? I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher. That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class. LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller? She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened. Sit down, I have something to tell you. I'm fine. Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years. Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes! Are you in special ed? I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything. He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight. Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM! I need help, Audrey. I don't know. I don't have it with me. When did you have it last? I don't remember Think. Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out -- I do. -- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday. Then you'll have to git ! Yeah, you'll have to git . Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter. I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit. What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base? No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane. I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet. Tell me, and then you can sleep. She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now... When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One. Your father never means to be so... I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important. Some kids were teasing you? That's not really the point. Y'know my lady Lucindy? The one with da big... Not her, the one with the little... Oh her. Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a... Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though. Yeah. Well, what did he say? He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now. The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes... Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates... Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren. Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die! We came here to deliver some clean laundry. It's all right. I really do know them. You're not my list. I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name -- -- I'm sure you did. Why this girl it makes no sense? I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us. Feeling a little better, I see. Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson. Quint...? No...  You think we can get back with those? It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting... I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn. What? What? Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st. Tonight? Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there. Look, that shit ain't mine. It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute? Weird. But different. But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered. Delivered from Swedish furniture. Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns. Delivered from Martha Stewart. Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia. Girl, what are you doing? Watching TV. I can see that. You watch too damn much TV. Research. Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star. Wait and see. If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged. I gotta stay up, Max. Jennifer -- Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip. Yo, Paulie. Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror. Yo, Paulie. What? Your sister's givin' me the shoulder. Forget her. You could do better than my sister. Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me. Looks, huh? Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister? My sister's a friggin' loser. Hey -- Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor. Don't get mental, man. Ya caught me in a bad mood. Ya always in a bad mood -- ...Adrian ain't sharp. Are you ready? Ready as I'll ever be. Yeah, but -- But what? What will I tell Annie? Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please... Yes, Saavik, go ahead... Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much? Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests. Well -- I have to see Carl first. Carl who? Just go ahead and tell us. There's nothing to tell. Superheroes. Should I kill them? Why bother? Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready. Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat! Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright. Oh, I have no doubt. If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson. Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat. Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned. Talk! A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar... Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar. Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches. Keep talking. Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied. And maybe you lie... In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars. What do you want? They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say. What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep? Suicide is a private thing. Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude. Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john. Jack!! SAM! What a surprise! Are you officer 412/L? Hank? Yes. Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow! That's a great idea. Are you a dream too? Still hallucinating as well. Hmm... What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality. It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open. Sherry.  Very old, very dry. Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty. I feel pretty. They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech. Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet. It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be? The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it? I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear? Still clear. What's the matter? Nothing... Let's get crazy! I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these. If I break it they can take it out of my pay. Look at all this junk. How's he doing? I got him in the stomach. No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas. Gas good? Yes. Very good. I don't know, I don't know, I just know it. Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts -- You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool. That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different. PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing? It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and... That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol... What else is there? And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head. It's not just in my head. Good morning. Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it? I don't know. Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married? Why - well, I  Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new? Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room. Directors, eh? Long faces? I would prefer some peanut butter. How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast? Toast?  No...just the butter. Right away. You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick. I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way. Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times. I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow. I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog. Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking... Then say so. Yes, Addison. And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me? Yes, Addison. Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight. He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it -- They're not costumes. Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow. What about? On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith. Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em? Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions. Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot... Anything --- It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole. What about time...? You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit? I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything. You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care. ...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it. ...Work okay? ...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right. We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight. There's plenty of fruit. You know where the fire extinguisher is. [Drive.] [Do you know who I am?] [You are Jorge Ramirez.] I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction. I'll check it. Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me! I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay? Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show? They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times. I need a new PR guy. Lord's name. Mother Mary, full of grace. What did you do, Connor? You got a comb? Don't need a comb. Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess. Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it? Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village  I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him. It's up to you. They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready. Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her. But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that! What would you do with it, the printshop... Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans... Yo, you gonna show, Tony? Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky. I never met anyone from Seattle before. You're not missing much. What are you doing in this shit-hole town? Virgil? God, I hate that bitch. Yeah, well you never should have married her then. I'll have the same. Of course. What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm? Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice... ...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important. Charlie? I'm doin' business here! But there's... Unknown!  What do you mean? It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man. Who are you to make assessments? I'll assess all I want! Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding. Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know? All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey. It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt -- These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark -- He said he didn't know about it. You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em. Wydell. Excuse me for a second. My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side.. I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her. Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy -- This is not cool. It was cool last night. I have to go. Are you telling me no? No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone.... ....this is your mistake.... Oh, no. ... what?... That headboard. Nobody can hear it. Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!! Sorry. Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden. Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree. Can I ask you kind of a weird question? Yeah. Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most? You mean now or before? Before. I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs. What little dogs? You know those little dogs you see people with? Like a Chihuahua? Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth? Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos. Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you? Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me. I can see that. I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it. Well, now, maybe you won't have to. Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya? You really don't act like a scientist. No?  What do I act like? Like a used car salesman. Thanks.  What's in there? What's that? Quiet, Mollie! There's somethin' funny going on around here. You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already. Why, somebody's complaining? I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book. That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone. Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you. What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all. I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you. All right. You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it. It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting-- You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know-- It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to-- It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real. It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real. So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps. I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back. Are you trying to panic the women? That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one. I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she? What are his symptoms? Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do? What does he say to do? He can hardly talk. Oh Jesus. I'm going home. Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light. It's a plain end, see? So? Take it off. Why? Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip    to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium? The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did. I'm not looking for an apology, Peter. I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could... I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you. You really haven't seen my best side. How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story? Did you change your hair? A little. Good evening, Lieutenant. No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash. I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it. That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were. It's late. What if I just left? Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink. What? Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy. Great. Stop this, stop this. Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart. What do you think you're doing ? I'm gonna save Carmen. That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico. Yeah, that's right. So, what's our first plan of attack Santa? While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant. He killed a man worked for him the other night. So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here? What is it? Thank you for seeing me. That's perfectly all right. This looks familiar... Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful. ... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up? I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table. Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here? Spit from your dad? I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt. Yeah. So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this. Y'think? I sure do. Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head. Oh, Jack... Why didn't I? Uh.  You hate my guts? Black... Leopard Skin... I'm John McClane. Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag. Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often? No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died. No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies? Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things. Like what? Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end. I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head? I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head. Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down. Is this cause of me? Because of the story? Well what the hell did you think was going to happen? You never said it was off the record. I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you. I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure. So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes? Exactly what is your previous experience? How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction. Did you reach the next girl yet? No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine. Send a unit. I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there. Call her. I just called. Call her again. How come you took your own car? I didn't want him meeting me here. Well that's something. What is. You didn't plan on fucking him tonight. Then maybe I d be... open to that. Perhaps after this ... test? ...yes?... I could come for a second opinion? Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas. Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man? You. Yeah, well I kinda figured that. You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck. Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios. They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu. Christ... Shu is innocent. You didn't shoot! Neither did you! I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to. That's what I figured, too. Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions. Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women. Why?  Are they what's most important? No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know? ... Everything. Everything about what? Well... about everything. Are you all squeaky clean now? Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment? Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay. A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney? You want to show this? Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did. I agree. I wish I could see him. Ludwig. Oskar. Who is it? Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now. What'd it say? I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you. Tell me now. It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address. Get me a plane... Wait, Will... Get me a plane! I'll pick you up in... I won't be here. That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood. Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later. Montana.  Energize. Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we -- Parker. Sir? What is that? What, sir? Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either. I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it. I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . . What? What? Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner? What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it? Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest. What? Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe. Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347. Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain. Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford. I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play. Where is she? You'll find her. If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it! I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember. Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby. I got a surprise for you. What? You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them. I don't want them now. I'll not denounce you. I know. So -- Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, -- But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go --- I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now. And now? I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable. Have we met before? Yeah. And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever. Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out. Oh, Sid, you re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious. You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos.. What's with Charlie? Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific. Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it? When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know. What are you going to do? I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car. Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner. I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department? I really can't give out any information right now at this point. Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct? He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine. Do you have the suspect in custody? Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously. Alright, cut, cut, cut. Who else knew I had the baby?! No one. No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?! Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn. That's too bad. What? Nothing.  Is that the kitchen? I need a favor. What's in it for me? I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on... Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life. Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me... Oh yeah... Oh yeah... Oh Sara... Anna... Anna... Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture. Oh, great. I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus. Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet . Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it. Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board. The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem. Good. Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them. What's your problem? I've got no problems. So, that's Ryan. Looks like a flaming asshole to me. What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls? Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know. I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency. Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse. No!!  Out! I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall. I'd love to. You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire. They can't be. They may not know it but they are. What's the matter with Miss Kubelik? Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs -- Fran been sick or something? You typed this report? Yes, sir.  Anything wrong? Wrong?  Look at this! I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works. Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him. I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit. Are they any agent? Yes. Goddamnit! You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it. Let's eat our cake. Yeah. Let's dig in! You're kidding. When for? Tomorrow morning, before the store opening. Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now. And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage. Thanks, honey. Good night, Sugar. Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us. Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers. Four men. Babylon soldiers. Can you walk? Victor, I'm sorry I -- Just <u>find</u> him. You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . What are the rules for a sweater vest? I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother. Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy. Over there! What do you see? At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine. They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery. Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows. Report. Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed... Rennie...?? The window... My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master? Sounds like a game show host to me. No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up. Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number? Where...where am I? Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine. Reed? ... Sue? They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine. You like kids? Never saw the point of 'em. Me, too.  You have a paperclip? Paperclip? Fix my glasses. Better idea... Now, Amy -- Consider this my resignation -- Holy shit. Are you serious? As a heart attack. Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here... I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you. Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it. Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff. Good day...! I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward. Oh, no. I knew you'd understand. Here. Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk? Outside? Yeah -- Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain. I don't see the connection. The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car. No. Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number? Ha un numero di telefono? How did it go with you guys? Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart? This just isn't the best moment for this. I know, I know. I had no idea -- That this was going to be a key party? Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already? Well? I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home. Damn it, Ben -- I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that -- You're not going to -- I'm not. You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch -- Elena. Who's that guy? Her husband. What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING? Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! This is not the time for squabbling. Sorry. Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler? We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along. Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations. Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week. A... week? We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm. Is that your diagnosis? Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now. You've been going round-the-clock? We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside. Everything in moderation, Clerval. Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein. What a surprise. Take as much room as you want No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier. Darling, may I have this one? That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there. Really? I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business -- -- well, if you're gonna go -- -- I'm probably not gonna go though. -- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something -- -- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it. Yo. Damone. It's Mark. Mark. What happened to your date? It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home. Did you go home and get it? No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here? I'll get the doctor. No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything. Pike, please -- Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge -- Hey, beautiful girls! Shhhhh. Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it! The colt's still too small. I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it? We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump. Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk. Save your mischief for the Black Baron. Aye!  That too. You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart. I'll drop a cow on the knave! Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops. No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything. Well... Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat. I don't have another cat! Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something. A parakeet? Ssh. Don't want babe to hear. You're hurting. You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse... Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room. Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves? A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey! Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again. Do you think it's done? I don't know. That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting. We'll think of something. Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know. You won't go to the police if I tell you? I will if you don't. You should stay away from a man when his blood is up. His blood's always up. This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays. You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary. But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed! That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed. You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none. Around here.  Yeah. If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source. Us. Lead us not into... ...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and... Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it... ...People get carjacked... Jenkins.  Can I get you some help? Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards! Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore-- Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone. Father...? I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you. It is kind of you to make this effort. It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises. Most kind, Father. What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion? What are you talking about? Who are you? Oh, excuse me... I'd like an ice-cold Heineken. That sounds good. Two. Joe, I'm with Drew. Not now. The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard. So why are you still here? Are we being watched? I'm not taking any chances. Time marches on. Ardor cools. No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there. Ah. You know what I mean when I say "it. Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex. Seems like there's more of it than ever before -- Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described? I don't know. I can assume... Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel? I'm not sure. And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities? Video. Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup? Why wouldn't it? I just don't think it would... You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted. I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man. Hi everybody. Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh. Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6? Would it be possible to use it for military purposes? Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible. Did you try to kill... What? Nothing. How's your hand? About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night? Like you don't know... I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say? I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded... I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine... Hey, I thought... What will you do after the war? I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones. What's a big question? Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him. Yes. What did you hear? That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz. What things? Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain. Yes. Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages? I know. But Captain, I mean -- cannibals. Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference. No, I couldn't do that. Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One? Ain't it there? Now it seems to me -- Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear? Get out of here! What are my orders, sir? You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me! You'll do it? I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate. We didn t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though... Did Leon tell you why he didn t want the police involved, Rhian? He just said he had good reasons. Good reasons? That s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn t take on another child, that he d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon s. He did beat the drug, though. He did. His mother would be pleased to hear that. Yeah... But he didn t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims. I m afraid I don t understand. They re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that s just one of Leon s dark delusions... Do you know Leon s parents names? Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why? Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations! Thank you, thank you very much! No!  It's too far away. There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it. Ol' satchel-butt... I know they're gonna buy that stock -- No. You look like you have. Stop that dog! This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented! Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up! Hi Jody. What can I DO for you? Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers? They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for? Twenty eight years ago. Follow me. They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room. I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now. James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West! Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this. I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop. Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this? Ask the chef. It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here. We don't know that for sure. Good things... What are you sure about? You goin' home? Yeah... You want a ride... Sure - How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ? Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette. You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it? I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back... Damn crooks is everywhere -- Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside. You have to sign for it. You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them. I don't want them now. I'll not denounce you. I know. So -- Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, -- But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go --- I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now. And now? I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable. Oh thank God, you're dead... It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they... You're with us in battle. May God protect you. Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope... Shu Lien... Save your strength. My life is departing.  I've only one breath left. Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me. I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit. Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College. Indeed, yes, those halcyon days. One of Edinburgh's finest schools. Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather -- I'm an old boy myself, you know? Oh, really? Do you recall the school motto? Of course, the motto, the motto -- Strive, hope, believe and conquer. Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world. Excuse me? They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant... You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business. He's important to my business. What do you want for him, I'll give it to you. I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time. When did you get back? Tuesday. Where'd you get that dress? Do you like it? It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them. Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick. No, I don't know.  Tell me. To change our minds. Of course you have three days. All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back. What kind of signal? Anything. Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw! Tommy, we have these... Walter...stay away from me! Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal. I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space. Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act. Who is it? It's Marika.  Is Paula there? She's at work.  I'm her mother. Oh.  I thought today was Saturday. So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it? Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep... Knaves and robbers... Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange. You ain't actin', mama. Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight? I need to talk to you. Why would they tow your truck? I was parked in day parking. Why call me? I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house. You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it. There's nothing anymore to stop me. Money? Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy. How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire... I love those doors. Where will you live? The garage. Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it. When's school over? Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day. I'll be by Saturday to pick him up. He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore. Not for the weekend.  For the summer. Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times. And, if it's a threat. We put her in a safe house. I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside. What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you? I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot. It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans? Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again. The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it. I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front... Available cash is not an issue for us... Twenty-eight-point-five. What if I pushed to twenty-one...? I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal... Maybe I'm only one. I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins. Martin, we hired the best man we could find. So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic. That's great, Harry. So what's the -- What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them. Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert... I don't want Robert. I see. Your foot! Give me your foot!! Oh, I'm terribly sorry. My fault. You're not hurt, are you? I don't think so. I wish you'd make sure. Why? Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars. Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. Thank you. Who are you? Now, really - I think you gotta camp it here... What are you talking about? Cotter'll kill you. He'll never know. Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back. Oh no, not you again. What an adorable hat. They think I have a concussion. And you think you're in love. I know it. This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion. Why should I believe you? It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl. Comb my hair out later, honey. No, that's okay, I'll do It now. No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight. I can't swim. I gathered that. Can I tell you a story, Rick? Has it got a wow finish? I don't know the finish yet. Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along. It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love. Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells? My God. What? ...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry. Are you in trouble, son?! I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist?! Let's call that a start. I can't do it. You've just done it - Kill me if you will, but I can't do this... I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms! Who said anything about brooms? Oh, you want to stay now? One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years. You think you're doing me a big favor by staying? I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor. We've come a long way since Homecoming. Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five. Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways. You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself! I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy. Come on--let's take a swim. What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians... I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that. No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely? Who is this? Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service -- Why don't you shut the fuck up? What? I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem? I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER. CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP -- She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around. Yes, sir, sheriff. Where is it! Please! AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH! I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here. I'm not sure... I don't know. Well, what do you want to know? And why? Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*. Ring the call to quorum. What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action. ...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>. If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we... Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ... It's your radiator hose.  It's busted. I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you? Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself? If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else? Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself? Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not? Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog. I had to. Didn't I? Couldn't you've just pulled him off me? No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought -- Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me. Do I know you? We've met before. Oh yeah, the insurance guy. ... No response, sir. Sensors, Captain? Jesse. Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride? Cole, he didn't mean that. Here we come at last, my lord! Are you bringing your laundry woman? Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina! On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches! I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors. Ask this one favor -- Of course I will. What is it? It was in the cellar.  Weird. Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event - Have you consulted a psychic? No. Had his apartment been burglarized? No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it. I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right? No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything. That's so typical, isn't it? It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then... Nothing. People just...disappear. The earth just opens up and swallows people. Eerie. Really eerie. This is good. Who did it? Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac. Maybe we should all get on it. For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?! Relax, I've been giving him lessons. Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it. Records are those big round black things, right? Fuck off. I'm starving. Will you please take it? Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me. Just wanted ta say hello. I said, is she Italian girl? I don't know. I don't think so. I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time. We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay. G-d, son. Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad? Sarah, do you think I'm a loser? A loser? Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser. Would he know? He knows. A lot. Why did he tell you? I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose. What does he do, this Bert Gordon? He's a gambler. Is he a winner? Well, he owns things. Is that what makes a winner? Well, what else does? Does it bother you? What he said? Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before. You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie. OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it. Where are his pants? Who knows? It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know. What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow. Nobody comes in here. You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it. What're you talkin' about? I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape. That's a lotta crap. Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is. How come I never hearda you before? I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent. Engaged. Let's take her into an escape orbit. [Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.] It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--. Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed. Paul. Are you alright? We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel. No! Bond! Bond! That's me, Clifford. I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy -- It's gone. I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it? Is that so? Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight. My, my... Ah, who are you? McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy. Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall. Will I see you again? Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to. These guys look like they'd sell their mothers. Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners. Pirates?  No kidding? You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket? We've done it before. Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry.. Would you prefer to do nothing? Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys. How is old Q? Gone fishing. Fishing? Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you... Really? No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore? I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy... Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana? Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know... So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff? Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon... Sounds good... I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia. Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France? England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs. Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K. Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside. And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here... Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but -- Hello. Sammy. Yeah, uh, who's this? It's me. Nick? Sure. I met you. Oh. What's happening about the opera? Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if  Shouldnt've done that. ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone. It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces--- I know. Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people. Now you're joking, right? Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family. Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in? You are in. You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the -- Larry, you just take it easy The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there? Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods! Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't. What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 - Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture. Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars. Dennis. ...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love-- Got a job for you. ...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it. It's not strictly legal. You ever think about running away? All the time. Jean? Sorbet? Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some. I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty. What about? All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open. Why don't you see Lester? Your husband? Yes. What about? The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him. Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star. You think that's all we busted -- You should see... Now where's she goin'? -- Maybe it won't stay in. Maybe you better just drive me home. Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now? I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight. Then... I guess you have to. There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me. Oh, Wade. I've been thinking about it, that's all. You've been married twice -- It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know? Alright. I'll think about it. Good. My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you? No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand. That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold. It's pitiful. Neither one of them know. I think Daddy suspects. No, he doesn't. Not really. C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo. No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in. Go in where? The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow. I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow. I'm gonna need some money. How much? Fuel up. Need fuel. Those are mine! You want 'em? Damn right! Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass. Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat - Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together? Because that would be too easy. Stu...Stu... IT'S NOT WORKING. There's a thing here! There's a switch! How do you like that? Right on time. The other elders will never let you get away with this! Should we bring the police into this? No, not yet. I want to ask you a question. Come in. No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley? Because -- I am. Is it because I'm here? What do you think? I think it is. What's this? A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird. Uh... What? I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase? Good point. Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop. Ah, negative drop. Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve. How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores? That's your problem. Where the hell are we? It looks like the furnace. Let's get outta here. Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand. I'm going to take that apartment uptown. Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time? Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who... If you find her... Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes ! Shut up ! It's me. I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination. What ? Nothing. That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit. That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't? I know. I know. They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it. I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect... Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party. Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown. Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany! Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day. Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside. How goes it, darlin'? Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here. What do you think of her, honey? Recall any names? Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim. Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas? Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog. Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail? There were no phone records. Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean. I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country. Lucky lady. Hi. Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here? ...Jesus H. Christ. So where's the party? But now... they are all one with the Borg. I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed. You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time. I don't like this. It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here. That's not true.  It was 1620. Same difference. I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night. Yeah, so what happened? I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop. Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here? Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis. What's he up to? He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them. I'm glad. But what's all this? The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his -- Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him! What's the matter, ch rie? Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune! What? A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him! Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya? Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us? How the hell did you do that? Magic. No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father. Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time. He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me. Who? The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus. You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie? C'mere. Guess! Go on. I don't know. You seem afraid. You're a regular Einstein, aren't you? Supergirl? I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia. Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom. I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna -- I don't know you, lady. But the other night... That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster. We're no leaving you! No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it! I don't know if you'd call it a boat... Something with an engine? Not oars? Step into my office. You know how to get back to the Windmill, right? Got it. I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did. Good. So did I. Okay. See you around. Um... did you still want to read my novel? Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course. I'm going to put a guard on your door. One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone. <u>He</u> won't. I had nothing to do with that fire. It's okay. Not directly anyhow ... It's fine. I got Clawsen on hold-- --his dialing finger must be falling off-- --what do you think?-- --he went to her apartment and he told her-- Did you listen to me? I was listening -- -- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me. -- and I'm through playin' games. ... What does that mean? He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong. I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales? ... You have a point... Hello. Jerome--? Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up. Mr. President! Mr. President! I addressed the Chair first, sir! I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or-- ...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian. ...Uh-huh. I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though. Ah... it's nothing. I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are? Huh. You're an enthusiast. Huh. Yeah. Maybe... My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well! What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy. He didn't look unhappy! Show.  Me.  The.  Money. Congratulations.  You're still my agent. Tell them!  Tell them! For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says. He had girlfriends! He says -- I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television! Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia. The militia? I think we went the wrong way. Oh, you think? ...you don't even know what you're looking for. You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss... Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you... No. Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money. No? No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul. I know that... ...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand. Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job. Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck. Whatever that means. Open your presents. You are the manager? Yes, sir. What is wrong? Everyone must leave the hotel now. Why sir? It's an order. Get everyone out now. I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping. How did they get their hands on Pentangeli? Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury. Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks... Instant V-goddam-D. This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain? Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right? You got it. No. You got it. Such as. Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you? Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store. Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think... They'll start to soon enough. Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow. Where you going? For a ride. With him? Yeah. Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder. It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent. Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny? You have to forgive me if I don't laugh. You're in with them. It's not what you think. You killed her! No. Stay away from me! Stay away! Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen. You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind? Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair. That a fact? Yeah.  It's a fact. Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them. What is this?  Who the hell are you? Who says? Mocky-Lock. Oh no... No you don't. Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am. I bet we can fix it. Any sign of Sounder? No mam -- I looked all over. I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself. Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game! Nineteen! Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up. That's too bad. What do you mean, too bad? Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again. Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a  Well, you know how they are in baseball if a guy's mixed up in a racket  Racket? What do you mean? Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you? Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh! And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove flopped into a chair and has taken out his ocarina. Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station. Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here... HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him. What!? I'm not going down there again! This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go. This is a bottleneck waiting to happen. There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date. Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you. Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing - But, Mr. M. - Just twelve. We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes. We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse. It won't work. Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss. Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight. He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand. When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter. And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief. The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know. Gee, thanks boss. What's that? Come on. What happened to your big "assignment"? What do you know about it? As much as ever.  Nothing. It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to? The hospital. The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha. Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge. Have fun at work. Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant. Why? He wouldn't say. You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline... I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment. They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this. Tough break. Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place? Did you and Dad have any other property? I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it. So you never bought any land. Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place. This is the hotel San Domenico? Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years. Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left? No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship. Ah?! Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ... But it must be done; your government is paralyzed. All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you? I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic. Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was. I'll rephrase the question. Thank you. Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day? I never rent my gear. There's a cavern at the base of the next hill... This way! What did he say? He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over. Do you remember his exact words? It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet. And that's exactly what he's going to do. Oh, for Christ's sake  - I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to. Did he get you the job? I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire .. Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you. I gave you my dog tags. No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow. How'd he die? I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up. I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now. It's December 25th, 1993 today. No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004. Let's not. I want a tape. But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job? Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card. What about, ah, non-union occupations? Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week? I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ... Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ... The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me. Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right? You're news, Sonny ... How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot? Newsman, not ... Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us? What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ... I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me? You could give up. Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison? Of course not ... Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ... Tell me about yourself. I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really. That's it? Not much else. What's your business? I'm a professional killer. Professional killer. Do you get dental with that? Hello...? This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship. You're fucking psycho. Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in. Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder. No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along... I've got a place I can hide her. You better get in there with her until this thing is over. And cigarettes.  I smoke, too. You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>! How about this? Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck. Hello again, neighbour. I didn t intrude, did I? How are you, Jane? Fine. How was the match? Did you loose? No. Must be your lucky day then. I ve got your accounts - you don t owe much tax for last year. Good. Yes. But my boss reckons you d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It d cost you about  100 but he said it d be worth it.  Of course, you d need a partner to register. But that s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right? ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that? I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night. What is this? They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war. That book wasn't Canadian! Where's Mitch? Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm. Why? Didn't Al believe my story? He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner. Then he saw. He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police. What good will they do? I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't. And what would you say... It's boring, isn't it? I can sit through it once. He thinks he's Joe Gunn now. I'm impressed. He knows a lot. He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am. Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man? No, sir. Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander. Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? . Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!.... You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster? One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing! Oh, God... But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people. I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun. Don't give me that police shit. You drop it. Hello, Daryll Lee. You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet. What book? I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...! I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today. Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse. And? And nothing.     He's just feeling us out. He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory. He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off. Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property. I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary. So, is this like a Japanese restaurant? I'd better get in there. That's a lot of people all at once. It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees. What are they? Maybe you better stay, then. No, I need to talk to you, about so many things... Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I? Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef. When did they find her? Are you telling me Friedman didn t tell you I was here looking for him? If he had, you d be dead. So why didn t he? What do you think, huh? I think you d rather not know what I think. Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only  cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk. So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me? That s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you re up to, eh, French-fuck? That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son. He didn't either. What about them? How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald. John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names. Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was. Four four.  A record. You don't seem too happy about it. Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better. Let me guess, Russia came up? Not that, you idiot. But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight. She was only teasin'. Oh, sure. Let me do that. - no.  She can t know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  There s too much at stake, Ethan. You re probably right. I usually am. Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  I ll call you from Paris. You got it. And get a doctor. Good luck. Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice! Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President. What's that? You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right? I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant. Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked? Nah. Traveling light. I like that. Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping? Shopping, really? I should tell my friend. Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room. Hi ho, Silver. That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that. No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case. The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants. Oh. Fry? Can't get my nose down...too much load back there.... You mean that "load" of passengers? So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility? How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers. Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all. So you do fantasize? Yes. About who? I fantasized about you. About me? Yes. Ever been tempted? What? To put one of these in my pocket? Uh-huh. If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right? Yes. All those things are true. After all, it don't belong to nobody, right? That would be one point of view. Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now. How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second? I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende? Si. I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial... There's nothing further to be gained from this... You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions. Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place. Ellie. Peter. ...Pardon? ...I said, I like your hair. ...Thank you. I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..? I'm sorry. It was in Chinatown. What were you doing there? Working for the District Attorney. Doing what? Yes.  Without question. Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor? The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects. Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it. He was lying. Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did. I thought he was lying. You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor? Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear. Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill. Just want to talk to him a second. He's dangerous. You don't know he did it. No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag. There. Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section! Did I do good, Mr. Luthor? Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long? They're so precious when they're asleep. You really enjoy yourself, don't you? Well... Don't. I know what you're going to say. No, really, Sara, I don't think you -- You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her. I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me. She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby. Let go of me! Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else... Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. I'm listening. As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend. Of what sort? You are a private investigator? That's right. Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval. Oh shit. What's wrong? Stop. What for? I'm spinning. I'm going to the powder room. Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons. I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it. What's that? Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested? You still wear the cable necklace I gave you. Call me sentimental. Remember the first time we came up here? Of course I do. It was great. You attacked me. Can you think of something more romantic than attacked? Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you. No, actually it was more like mutual attacking. I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors. Clean up?  I don't... How'd you know where to find me? You were the only Sullivan in the phone book. I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class. Jesus Christ, what next? Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three. Good-bye. If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me. I won't get lonely. Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!? Help me get her off the rug. Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell! Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife. For the last time -- SURRENDER! DEATH FIRST!! Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation? Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here. I'm not a baby. You're a big girl, huh? I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby. I feel bad for his family. Yeah. Did you know him? Thank you. You're a nice man. If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us. Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>. Hey.  I got another question for you. What's that? Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project -- Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here. I only wear ties for funerals. You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen. Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable. No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that. Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation. I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief. You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita... You're all making me blush... I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success. That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly. Yeah, me too, Keri. Call me Laurie, will ya? Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom? That would work. The leaves... Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast. Look for antiques... Yep.  There's some great places nearby. Adamant. What? Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming. Huh. Do you know it? Don't think so. Maybe we can stop there for lunch. I went out in my goddamn underwear too. Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry. Not really to live, just to play. That building? Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them? Should I? Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3 Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this! But she isn't due for an hour, sir. An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it. Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir. I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name. Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead.... I may call you worse than that. Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy? The Cowboy?? Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea. Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters? Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away. Cynthia...what's going on? It's been a very strange day. And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range? Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be. You gotta be kidding? Will you meet with him? Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When? I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place. It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it? Gotta come from somewhere... Where do you come from, Marvosa? Viva la Resistance. Oh no, it's that kid. This is the place-- ...and we're chock full of that! Damn right! My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?! And how is Lord Lavenham? ...and little Lady Beatrice? And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts? My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist. Don't bother asking, we already tried. It's so very nice to see you again. You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll... Sheriff, you better take this. Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready? Coming up. Get going on the trap door. You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that? But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living. All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains -- If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs. Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours. Not in the eyes of the law. Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield? When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell? Let s go, Jock. Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'? You re drunk. They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are? Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean? Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant. Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it? Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray. How're you feeling this morning? Fine... fine. Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen. I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned. We're going to friends now, sir. I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial. What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep? Oh no, nothing of the sort. Vitamins will it be then? Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum. What exactly is the treatment here going to be then? It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films. You mean like going to the pictures? Something like that. Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again. Hmmm... And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you. She never particularly cared for me. She didn't love you? No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup -- She held that against you? Apparently she was very disappointed. Boy. Boy, oh boy. This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up -- THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE! Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now -- THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM. -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now. It was a community service. Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward! Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake -- He was going to take away all my data, equipment -- Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are. I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there. What do you have, Danny? You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it. And? There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know. It was staged? Is it a slam dunk? No, but... Jesus... Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this? Keep going... Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin? Lots of people... Including Landy...  She had access to the archives. So are you getting on the plane or not?! What? Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first. I cannot go to LA... ...leave me alone... please... Answer the question and I will. Such the flirt. U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation. Who's the nut? That's Thelma Dickinson's husband. Aw, God. Hello? Hey. What are you doing? How are you? I'm fine. Who is this? Georgia. Hi....what....what's up....? It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok. Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on? I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey. I'm going to work. Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep? Not very late. You're going to work now? Yes. Can I ask you a question? Uh-huh. Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember? Yes. This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money. Me? Yeah. I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it. You don't even know how much it is. I know but I....how much is it? Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty? Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry. Really? Please? You have trouble, financial trouble? Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it. Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that. I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff.... It's a lie! Mr. Cedar! Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination! No way man... You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice. You're one of William's kids, huh? His only kid. Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike. We were very close. The resemblance is amazing. When may I expect the cleaners? I'll send them right up. Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult? Objection! You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate? They can have the Estate. No prob. I'm cool. Thanks, Scoob. What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way? It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it. I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you? Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit. Copy that. And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired. Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was -- Paul? Yeah. You think -- Wha--  What kind of things do you build? Are you really interested? Yeah. What? Nothing. Go ahead. Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy? It's not that easy. Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt. Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch. Then leave. I can't. Why not? You don't understand. There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig. I can't leave. You get off on abuse or something? Fuck you. Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason. Because he'll kill me. What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore? Lay off, can't you? Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby? Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me. Okay -- for you. Thanks.  This is my exit so, I -- I'm glad we talked. Good-bye. I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett. Oh, yes. On the pier. Before that. Your face is very familiar. Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago? No--not quite. So was he scared? Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him. Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student? Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one. The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl! - <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>... Bones, are you afraid of the future? That was the general idea I intended to convey. I didn't mean this future. Are we playing multiple choice? Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened. Specifically of...? No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right. Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same - Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why. Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to - Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message. Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene. That's right... I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug? Thanks for taking care of this for me. Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy. It's for you. Frida. Tell her I'm eating. I heard you were looking for this. You're the guy killed Dutton. I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you. There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's- You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'... m not worried about this kid. Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts. Postpone. We have every right. Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater. I've had three straight washouts, Sidney. You're dangling from the last letter of your last name. Whoo! Whoo! Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma? I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son. Do you really think that? Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference. I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways -- Wouldn't profit him none. That's maybe the best compliment of my life. Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out. Anywhere you want? Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want. Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision. No, come on. Anywhere you want. Oh, I can't.  I don't know. Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere. You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...? Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer. In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll. There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them? Six. How many wings have they got between them? Twelve. How many feet? Er, well, twelve. That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got? How the fuck should I know? How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?] A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right. The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is. We all know what right is, Senator. Your Honor, I object. Proceed. Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink. In a minute. Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it? Ed, it was only one review. Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30! Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling. I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get... Do you believe in him, Verbal? Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE. Where is he? I don't know. Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it. Auto-shop? I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since. Find him!  I want to talk to him. ...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat. That wasn't funny. The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again. I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car. It's your car. These are all your cars. Some of them have to be automatics. Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy. Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law. Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not? YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS- Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS! Where is it! Please! AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH! What does it mean? That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round! I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more... Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them. Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ... Does wood sink in water? No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond. Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water? Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ... You comfy? If I could have a little more room. There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can? For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth. You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders. ...of course you do.  You don't remember me? I take it I should. I'm sorry. We were engaged. But, Luke... Take it easy, Drag. Luke. Where you goin? On my own. But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both. Jake... It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys. Talk to me. We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act. Let's boogie. Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ... Her doctors killed her. ) I'm sorry ...? Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her. Do you know who her doctors were? I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were. The most respected ... Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill? Hello? I'm not... You said we would be safe in Philadelphia. I was wrong. I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain -- Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro. You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT! We can't risk letting them in. Right. ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK. SHIT!! 30   CONTINUED: Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want. It could be fun. Yeah... It could be fun. Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki... Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay? Tuna, this is crap. I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial. It's garbage. Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things... Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie. Myra followed you, huh? She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash? No. No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me? I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it. As though you do what I say. That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix? I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck. No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around? I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so. We're screwed! 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?! You got a pilot's license, Marty? Do I need one? We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful. People have the right to know. If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her. What did he say? He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower. I don't think this is any time to be funny... He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone. ... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act... So it was "love". Yeah.  It was. And "is"...? What do you like? If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive. You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson? Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera? Yeah-- Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks. Can we make it a hundred? Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff. I heard it too. Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now? ...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't... Honey?... Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what? We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves. So, this is Leto the Just... I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born. Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders... You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie? I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs. Well, how about these two movies? This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself. I just don't believe that! You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow -- Such as? What a waste of lives and opportunities and -- Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can. Just asking. Oh... my... God! Quiet. Are you open? Yes. Just the paper. Thirty-fire. There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red. I'd put my money on that Vigo character. What do you mean, no? The kid said -- No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door. How do I know you are cops? Tina, you're sweating. Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here. Lie down, please. Bullshit. No bullshit. I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that? I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed. I still am. Is that right? That's right. Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it. Congratulations. Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody. Do you feel much about the things you did? I didn't do anything wrong. Tell that to Muskie. Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff. During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls. Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record. You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians. I didn't. But you know who did. When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful? Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face. I'm starting my own collection. It's Canadian. Where'd you get it? If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay? We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with. What else can we do? Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go. You read Russian? Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background... Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit... Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody... How do you know? Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian... I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone. You mean -- you really want to draw me? Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head. But why? Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him. And it's just my head you want? Nothing else? What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder. You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right? I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that. Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is? Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit. Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine. Am I home? You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh? Are we in Brooklyn? You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up. One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are. Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place. I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player. Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
