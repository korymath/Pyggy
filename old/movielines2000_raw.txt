What are you doing here? I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do. How did you find out? It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry. Thank you. What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf. All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that. It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years? It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this? Who was that? Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything? This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses. You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis. Good idea. Good luck, Richard. Someone down here? You glad? Yes, I'm glad. Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but -- <u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>. Do you have me? I think so. Show me. Can't see a thing. I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to... But you were coming up anyway, remember? I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head! Right next to the one you already had. Look, Mr. Brenner... Miss Viridiana ... Are you Jorge? Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston? The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that? She's my daughter, Tom. So? So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex. Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows? You really look awful. Not half as bad as I feel. Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed. Wyatt Earp is my friend. Hell, I got lot's of friends. I don't. So, two days? Yeah. I guess you could call it that. Why can't I let go of this woman? Well... Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened. What? -- go on -- My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you. People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning. Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox. It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony. My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels? You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you. Unnhh. The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too. Urgh. Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love! Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all... Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk... Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye. But... Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home. Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey? Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine-- Goodnight, Senator-- Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh? We found some bodies -- let's get out a here. Were you also the one who painted the statues? Oh, yes. How did you like that? Well, I didn't. Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time. But wait... I can't. Let me see it. Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this. No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite. Hi. Hi. So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house? That's the plan. Good enough! Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house? I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes. You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to? Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming. What does that mean? Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve. Sounds to me like a well educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next. What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before. Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee. Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love? Nick, you're so strange... Stop this, stop this. Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart. Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose... Not now Bork. Are you following me? I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi. Hi Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"? I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders. What does that even mean? I'll do my best. Is the place open. Yep, it's all yours. Okay. What d'ya got? Yamaha white.  Nice. My mother can't have any more kids. Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant. Jesus Christ!! What the hell are you doing?!! What are <u>you</u> doing?! You're crawling around like a-- I'm laying a spring trap! A spring trap! I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night-- I coulda shot you, you-- This could end up saving your life,-- Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money. How? Ted, we've only got ten minutes. Not now, Elaine. I mean until we start to burn up. Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling. What is this?  A whole new train? Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders? Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power -- -- Thank you. By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte. Yes. I believe you have a message for him? Nothing important, but may I speak to him now? Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do? I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market. ... How? We are totally booked. Oh really? That's great. I said we are totally booked. Two at nine? Perfect. There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked. See you then. What about your wife? What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North. It's an art book. Oh my Gosh, Bud ... Open it. It makes me sad. What? I used to live here. But you hated four out of the five you did. I was here six years.  And I only hated two. Which? The first and the last. You can have this for ten cents. I don't wanta rob you, ma'am. Go ahead--Bert says take it. Hey! We're gettin' married--! Right now--everything I own--! The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied. Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter. I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance. Clever.  George. They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu. Christ... Shu is innocent. Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago. Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred! Is the baby okay? Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this... Are these me considered armed and dangerous? Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah. Bye, Mama... Bye, son -- I won't be gone long. Can I have my desk please. Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia? Lydia?!  Lydia who!? I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second. You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long... What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh... ... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This! ...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>! Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap! Luthor, you poisonous snake . . . --yeah, a hand or something-- --coming out of the water-- Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed? Well... where can we go? Besides, we don't know the city and-- Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go! Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him. Sam? Yes. He came from Paris with Rick. Rick? Who's he? Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is -- -- Is what? Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man. I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time. Can I show you something? This time. What about next time? There won't be a next time, I guarantee it. Who is it? What do we do? If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited. I'll tell you at the end of the week. What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line. Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery. You guess?  Did he or didn't he? Yeah... okay... he did And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little... I wanna go home now. Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself. Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art. I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about. It's easy. I've done it. Who with? Pauline. Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how. John, we - - what I'm just saying.... Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious. Now, that wasn't too polite, was it? I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan. What? Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here. You have a thing against museums? I got nothing against-- Ever even been <u>in</u> one? ...I think rust. Rust? As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood? I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip. Who with? Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - - Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over. Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food... Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here. Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards... What movies? Ask me what I don't have. Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me? It'll be okay. He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare. How many of these you gonna eat, huh? Two. Two? Why did you let it get into a populated area? It's taken on a disguise. Clarify that. It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband. ...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals. What's 'incidentals? Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you. Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity... Forever". Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes. There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument". Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity? If it's on the page... I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents. They're out of town. Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights. I'm sorry. That was... No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere. This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull. Oh, my God! Where are you hurt, son? I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda. You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again... Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before. Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip. Do you feel much about the things you did? I didn't do anything wrong. Tell that to Muskie. Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff. During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls. Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record. You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians. I didn't. But you know who did. When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful? You ever come to your father's grave anymore? No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far. We should talk. We've done all our talking, Wade. It's just... Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone. Dignan. Take it easy. Bob! So like, yeah I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like  still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews Y'know, I figure I can always drop out. So where'd you get in? Prnceton. But what did you get on your SATs? 200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird. Sorry? .. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee .. If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place? What? Your offense?  Why are you here? I don't want to talk about it. Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime? Not really, no. No? I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego. Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here? Theo, I want you to get out of this town. I'm getting to like it here. Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour? I gotta survive. He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life. You got a better offer? No... I didn't think so. You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack? Twenty-eight years, Frank. Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye! That's what I deserve for listening in the first place. Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up. Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved -- With computers. It's not the same, is it? Better than playing with yourself. Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine. Burt, can you hear me now? Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back. You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket. Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening? I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all. You found a flop! A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty! What have you done with the ring? It's magic. Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal! Thank you. Look at this! I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one. Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't. You need a new car anyway. One called Magua arrived. He delivered no such message. All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around. I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry. God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech? No. Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. You remember me...? How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you. Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night. Oh, I'm feeling much better now. All right, all right.  Hey, hey. Hey.   Mason. Yeah. I think you oughta cut a... ...deal with this asshole. Even though it is nice to see Andy... ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt... ...or my conscience. A-And you  owe me... ...man. Yeah, I know, I know. Heading three-three-four... ...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees... One-four degrees... Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one! I never hear the whistle. Feed the dogs. Very noble.  Not smart, but noble. You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life. Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy. What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ... You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing? We both know what you were doing. Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything. What's the plan? This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy. We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them? Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out. We just take pictures? Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you. An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust. No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos. Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them. It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid. Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten. Guaranteed, eh? Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it? Damn straight! You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative? Fuck him. This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack. Fuck him. Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him. Is this what you gave Mary? That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle. What took you so long? Couldn't find my toothbrush. Ta ta, Hudson Hawk. Too-do-loo, babe. I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes. Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy. You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos. I'm still not clear on Chaos. It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine. Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people. Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something? Yes. I think that's very fair. What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there? It's hard to say Capt'n. Take a wild stab! I'll say enough to destroy this wing. The entire wing? That's my opinion. Jesus... I'm sorry, I can't. Listen, dammit. I just can't. Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can t satisfy him? You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I... You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT? So what do you do the rest of the time? You mean when I'm not running the country? Yes. I run a temp agency. J ai bien peur qu il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matin e. Tu sais o  me trouver. What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona? How does a nice mature fuck sound? You gotta kill yourself. I'll just go to Heaven. Don't you, child? Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear... No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make. They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids. We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch. Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo. Duck! Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time. If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento... What's in the needle? Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do... Don't worry.  I'll do something. I like that. I still think we should have met them first. Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember? What are you doing? I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight. But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water? Fight it. But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency? Then pull the emergency brake! Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery. Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'? For you, anything. Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it. Will you try...for me, please? Why Picton? He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier? You think you could explain all this to me? I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings. Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I? That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy. Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too? You bet.  Did you like it? General Bonaparte? Come back in an hour. Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention. Come in. West was one thing, but this -- Shut up, Mueller. But, you do come from a military family? I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I. No thanks. I'm heading back. Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come. Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door. Mr. Hardy? Dr. Thompson...? It was good of you to meet... No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie? Doucet killed my partner. You get it yet? Naw, nothing. You will.  You'll get it. I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open. You really think there's a treasure inside? I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing. What sample? You're standing on it. Dr. Zaius -- Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius? Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes. You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs? Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again. So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again. I can't. What? Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ... I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in. Where's Positano? It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning... Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea. Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you. Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight! As long as we keep moving. No standing still. C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood! What? The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous. Well, I wasn't nervous. She's changed. Oh, yes. She used to be so friendly. Tell, tell, tell me again. ....we landing? Tell me again. Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will... We can't <u>afford</u> a war. We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war. I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war. What's it gonna cost? But, but, but, "they" would find out. Who would find out? ...the... The American "people"? Yes Who's gonna tell'em. ...but... What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>. ...you want us to go to War... ...that's the general idea. Why? Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>... ...they sound what? <u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em... Hold on, hold on, hold on: Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know. <u>Who</u>? Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it.... Remember him? He was a bit proud as I recall. He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning. He turned out all right. Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?! Val!  Val! Khan could be down there! He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt. I can spare me... It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast? Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first. What's wrong with you? I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up. Will we see you later? I can't later. And tomorrow? Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna? I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time? Ten thirty? We'll be there. Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you. We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful. Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter. Then why ain't he dead? They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time. Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it. Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'? Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here. Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise? Yeah. A raise . . Dude, do you know what you're doing? No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works. He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold. Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea.... You don't know him? No! Should I? Are you okay? What do you mean? It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know? Like how? I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same. I walk differently? I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but... I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us. What're we having? My special, scrambled eggs surprise. Scrambled eggs surprise? What the devil? Getting around, Martins. Oh, pinning things on girls now. Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide. Dump it. Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it. Uh-huh. How d'ya like them apples? No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted. No, sir! Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .? Yes, sir. Found no skeletons? No, sir. It's haunted just the same. Yes, sir. So what's unique? Not what.  Who. Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in. Well, it's very... homely. Give 'em the horn, Bob. Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?! It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for. Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here. Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too? Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend? I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30. 6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down? I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this. Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate? well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that. Is that so? Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight. My, my... Ah, who are you? McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy. She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--? You wanna take the chance, Casper? Not me. No way. Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car. How you holdin' up, kid? Fine... That guy's great. Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see? See what? Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this. My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor? A favor? Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools. Oh, I'm sorry -- No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin. Are they really? Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ... No, no trouble.  There's other work to do. You're doing everything yourself? Yeah. That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic. What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him. Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no. I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death. If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him? I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb- Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with. Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it. What about my money? How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol- Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way. Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy. I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy. How's it feel, Tommy? Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear? Looks like you done it. I kinda thought so. Felt like it. Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella. They killed Casy first. That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust. They know what--this fella looks like? They know he got hit in the face. I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it. It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you. I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks. Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me. Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay. If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning. We don't have much choice then, do we? I'm an idiot? Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though. Really, "The Freeman Centre"? No....The Asylum! Oh yeah, what's my connection to that? None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts. I've been saying that since we met. Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing. Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped. What? Faster!  Eat faster! Why don't you help us? Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry. What did I do to you? You've made my dreams silly. Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?! Yes, sir! Can't see a thing. I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to... But you were coming up anyway, remember? I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head! Right next to the one you already had. Look, Mr. Brenner... Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license. Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend- Just give me the license, please. Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal. He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital. We can't take him to a hospital. Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die. Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up. So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain. You gotta idea, spit it out. Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him. Wow.  I'm losing it. No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly. You got a date already? We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist   she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me. There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together. Oh, I don't mind. That DD-5. What, the lunatic who -- Cecil Stipe." Find it. Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya? Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight? There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.  Hey, doc.  Might wanna... ...try this one out some-... ...-time. Excellent.  Drive in. What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back. I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard. You say Asia can be found by sailing west? Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks. Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus? I am, Your Eminence Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable. I'm sick with practicing, that's it... I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything. Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise. Huh? That's smart! I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music. Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living? ...Composer. Huh, that's good! Yeah, but he's not exactly my father... Huh? ...No... he's my lover... Arrest them! What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this! Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away. I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh? It's not what you think, Jake. No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it! Wait a minute.  Just listen to me... ...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000... Ew ... when did you get that? This morning at Seymour's garage sale. God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet? Nothing is going on with us, is it? Going on? When I picked you up from the train station...what you said. What did I say? That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that? That was the truth. You've never said that before. I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit. It sounded like a pick-up line. I can't pick you up. Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff? Sure. And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped? It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying. Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek. How long...? You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm-- --my number one fan. I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction. I'll check it. ...You need to talk to me. I don't need to talk to you. I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going? Why would I care where you're going. Do you know where I'm going? Where's the fire? Shreck's."  You -- Oh, you want to stay now? One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years. You think you're doing me a big favor by staying? I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor. You got a prob-... ...-lem too? No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.  Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though. About what? The forbidden subject. Really? Did you play in a band? Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar. What's going on, Kay? I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds. The radio show? No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards. You think that's what's-happening? I think that's what's happening... I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture. From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you. Why? I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't... And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then. I'm glad. Nice. I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. They're waving... handkerchiefs or something. What? Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth. Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day -- You have a red shirt. This is not an appropriate time for a conversation. Why? Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle. Why? Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE! We can't make it. You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel. Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side. Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem. Yes, I hope so as well. Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction? Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about. He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself. Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it. Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back. Good to know you, Karl. So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words... Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it... Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out.... If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means? Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find. I guess that's a no. I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you? What about me? I don't know. Why are you into wine? I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about. Yeah? Like what? Like what a fraud he was. We made it, man. No problem. The War ain't over. I saw it on TV. The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh... But, then, I don't have a choice. Och, you do, Fergie. Of course. I forgot. Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal. Ginger called me. Yeah. I just told you. She called me. And what'd she want? She was afraid to call you. Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy. She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait. Yes. That's all you got to say? "Yes". Yes. She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long? Yes. Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough. I think I'm gonna move Back East. Well, that's dumb. What's dumb about it? Well, you're doing so well... How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing? At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy... They turned you down? They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job. What did the six-toes have to say? Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own. So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play. But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar? I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love... Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask. I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there. Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll? No. I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this-- To my invaluable comrade Drink up! Where have you been? I went for a drive. Up in the hills. You ever see a palm tree, Homer? He ain't never been outta Maine! No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely! Your Majesty -- Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too. Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the... -- the coin? Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV. Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me. What'd ya mean? Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga. What? I need a favor. That requires me goin' out tonight? A bit. Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high -- Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me. I guess maybe I won't write that book after all. Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try? You! Don't make me laugh. You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car and I won't use my thumb. What about Betelgeuse? Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>. How nice -- your daughters? My daughters -- yes, my daughters. Is that Mrs. Preysing. Definitely off. Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life -- -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld. Exactly -- You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together? From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn. Go ahead. Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness. Why do you want to teach me? I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets. And if I use them to kill you? That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you. You want to dance? Okay. How do we do it? First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you... I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock? Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife. I know. And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one. Lucky girl. I'm sorry, Jenny. I am. Like fuck you are. Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are. I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play. We're getting that anyway. What is she doing?  Okay, 20%. No.  We need the gig. 110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play. We're not as bad as you think, Rob. You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them? We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey. Sonic Death Monkey. What do you think?  Dick likes it. Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey. I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact. You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night. That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready. The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink? I think I will. Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's. Okay. Fine. His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator. Bag him. I am eternally in your debt. And I in yours. Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick? Of course. Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him. I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet. Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night. Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it. Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands? Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me. Baby, I didn't -- It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail. Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you? This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing! Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going. Uh-oh... ... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher... Jesus... ...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead. Meurice-- You don't look too good. You sleep last night? What has the old fool got himself into now? I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head! Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life. Blimey.  What's that? The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her! Well, thanks, that's great. It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy. Why me? You brought the cameras here! You brought the girl! Please! If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too. They're beautiful. May I have one too please? No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible. It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise. I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you. Where are we going, sir? For supplies, you drive. The fog is too heavy, sir. Just drive, Gregoire. Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us? Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife..... They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger? Nagger? No, nigger. Nigger. That's my girl. And tell Merrill to swing away. What?  Colleen?... Colleen? Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god... Exactly.  Break it to her gently. What about Isabelle? We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner. Did you use the alarm system since we were here last? The first night... Not the last two. Do you want an aisle or a window seat? Window. Do you want a fruit plate? I don't know.  Do I? I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything. I guess you admire musicians. Some. Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same. Hi. Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry! You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps. Actually, he's a really nice guy. She's here, your wounded one. What are you saying? You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine... Come up to the fire, honey. I think I'll just lie down awhile Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay? At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better. Mother! I can make my own decisions. Don't stop. O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. This is better than sex any day.  This is romance! Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation... You and your pep talks. Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for. That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer... No. Long term psychic or physiological repercussions? No. Don't be an ass. Can I be anyone I want? You can be John Malkovich. Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire! Two hundred dollars, please. Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes! You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed. Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek. Not in this thing. You're late. Got here as soon as I could. Dance with me... You know I can't. Trust me... He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage. Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner. -- is that what this is all about? Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks -- Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him. What are you talking about? -- think what you have time to think, Lester. Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious? It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter. Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies. I'm sorry. Edie! I  I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows. I don't rate it. Go ahead, wear it. Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good. Uh-uh. Are you feeling okay? Uh-uh. What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on? If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there. What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on? Don't stop. O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. This is better than sex any day.  This is romance! Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much... I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!! Oh I wouldn't think of it. Well how can I repay you? It's okay, really. Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some? Sure. Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes. Are we gonna keep going with this game? Yes. You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this -- Alright. hang in there, ok. I love you. The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills. It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar. I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love? Pam Grier. No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier. What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now. Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her. This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me. Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton. These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide? Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe? You guys are thrashed. Not even a rhinoceros? Imposserous! Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh? long pause) You know it. Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust. Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory. It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better. Dude, we were practically made... I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in? No. I'll wait here. I'll be a minute. You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman. No. Or her name? No. Ow! What's the matter? It's too rough. Since when? Hi, Hank. MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!! I could kill that no good son of a bitch! All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this! Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls. Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth... Stop this, stop this. Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart. I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures. Of course. Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl. But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe. You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz. That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you. Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy. Bet I do. Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name -- 60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ". It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John. Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack? You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to. Murder.  Beautiful. Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant. Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no? Course you didn't. But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat. I know Steve.  No. Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets? Steed ... ! Mrs. Peel ... ? Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy? Exactly where is she? ..in the building... No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around! Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards! Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me! When were you most happy? Now. When were you least happy? Now. Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything. What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths. Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play? Oh, you remember her, Annie. Yes, I do. ...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer... And that's where you met Oswald for the first time? Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as... This a friend of yours? He is now. Who is he? Oh, a guy who got run out of town... So who's the broad? Broad?! Are you sure? Totally! Look! Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here. Really?  So, what is this, a party? I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right? If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design. You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star. Can you put me in the ring with him? I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo? Jean Michel Basquiat. I ll go for a cup of coffee! Yes! Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up? She thinks you went to the police. WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police? I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow. You will find them when you find sivlalinga. I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here. What's this? My house. How you doing? I'm fine. Kind of tired. Yeah, me too. I thought you said you could handle him. I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal. Look, I'm a lawyer and -- -- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other. We"? I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers. Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow. Uh-huh. See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder. Well... maybe... And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do! The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone... ... maybe it's congratulations. Torch it over there! The dogs? Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!! You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups. Why don't we go together? No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them. What are you doing in Information Retrieval? Looking for you. No, really. Really. I mean, it doesn't suit you. Suit me? Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does? What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists? We've got both. Things would be worse without Information Retrieval. They couldn't be worse for the Buttles. Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good. Did you have a nice time? Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful. Horrible... You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something. You're violating the laws of the universe. This universe? Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up. I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references. And I don't give a shit. May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill. Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch. I told you, 'watch it'. T-w~e-l-v~e. Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic. And you can?  Power it up? Did I miss anything? Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way. Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to? Eric, your parents are both here. In Costa Rica? On the island. What makes you say that? We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity. When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind. Any weapons, radios? Obviously! But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone. What theater was I at? The Orpheum. Anything this time? I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry. Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights? Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf. It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth... Really? How about starting with tonight? Good morning. Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying.. No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of.. Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess... You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you? What would that make Mom? You're right... not even to mention you and me. Like one? Fuck you. What's with that guy? Gotta be one of his disciples or something. So what are you going to do? Do? I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home. Let's talk about you for a change. There's nothing to talk about. Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me. Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure. You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family. I can handle it. They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it? You have enough worries of your own. No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you? Why do you ask? Just an idle question. If it's just idle, I won't answer it. Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades. They've gotta be joking. What time is it? It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you. Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood. I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting. Where is the meeting going to be? At the ship. Son of a bitch! Where are you taking me? To the bed. Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed. Dad...? What'd you say? What is it? I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do. Is there any way out of it? Seems to be all around... What about down? I...don't know! We're working for the King. Wait a second... Who's the mope? Parking permits... Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van. My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well? Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin. You listening to me? Yes!  I'm trying, I swear! Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One... Two... It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up! I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it? Yes. I wish you'd tell me who. I wish you'd tell me. Don't be like that -- You heard me -- Who's sitting here? Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back. Sue who? You...him...UST. Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another. Wade, are you alright? But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office. Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or... No.  No. You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died. I wish she hadn't. I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die. Why don't you let at do that...? Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D. Doctor's orders- - -? Captain's orders. I didn't know you could fly a plane. Fly... yes. Land... no. Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians. Nice doing business with you, George. Not bad for a weekend's work, huh? Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor. No it's fine, really, uh-- Do you have any news regarding my father's money? I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all. She most certainly was not! Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got-- And please don't call her my mother. Now I got-- She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim. I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence-- From who? The main guy, Dieter-- Dieter Hauff? Well--yeah, I guess-- Her "co-star" in the beaver picture? Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him? Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn. You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked. I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now? What's this? Your pay. Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show. Take it now. What about tomorrow? We don't need you, Frankie. He needs a room, Dusty. I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option. Stand right here. Where? I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you. Like you protected Landry? I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for. What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager ! It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran. Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ? Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? I really hate to bother him, but... Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired. So. So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits. This is an official visit, then-- I assume a lot of your business is from our people. Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone! Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster! I was called away on urgent business, Snake. Don't lie to me. All right, so I made another deal. I got a new deal for you. I'm not usually drunk. Not usually this drunk. Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing? Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled. Ed! How did you know I was here? You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this? Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore! Ma... I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us! And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home. I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy! Are you crazy? Let's see how much he wants to play. Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see? The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there. Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house. You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all. Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off... I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump. At the Frankenstein Center. Are you nuts? Get out of there! I'm going inside. What are you talking about? Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing. He's a psycho! He'll kill you! Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you -- And what if you get killed? Then at least I will have died trying, right? He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up! What happened? What's your name? What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian. You like being a hooker, Vivian? It pays. So do day jobs. Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right. I can't go to the club tonight, guys. Why? Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...? I don't drink. Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie... They don't do much of anything...! There's a square dance at the social hall this evening. What's that? You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for. You asked for shoe polish. My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload. So I'm responsible for the weather? I asked for metal, you gave me glass. This is not my problem. Look it up. Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir. Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone". One of his best parts. No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney. Ride the Clouds". Good picture. I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue. Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along? Not at all. Lot of potatoes! It's for Shelly's famous potato salad. I'm looking forward to that. Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed. Thank you, sir. You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte. Thank you, sir.  I will do that. You may go, Captain Charles. What do you want? Conklin. He's dead. Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more? I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family. Listen -- could you stop crying, please? No, I couldn't. But could you try? No. You have to go for help. I'll be right back. I'll wait here. Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50. Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night. We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch. I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football. Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day. What's the matter? Sweeney. Dead? Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby! Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he? I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country? Well, haven't you got anybody else? There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy! No! You've got to help me, Hildy. Keep away -- It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be. That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere! Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper. Get away, Svengali. If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week. Listen, you bumble-headed baboon -- All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more! Please! Will you just -- Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you? I'm not working for any other paper! Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack -- Look at this! Just get around so your lights are on the hatch. Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right? Yeah, buddy? Can you borrow me a dime? Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change... No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him. Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me. What was that? Bela died. What? The contract was stolen. Julius Caesar never took no vote. And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.  EXT. FORT LEAVENWORTH - TEN YEARS LATER - DAY. I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you? Yes...but...how did you... I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain! That's enough, Yvonne! Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible. She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own. Jim... Oh no. How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon. Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book. Ever seen anything like that before? No. Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent... Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again. So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus? I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy. I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me. I only asked. Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye. Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next. Helen, tell Matt I want to see him. Yes, sir. Where do we go -- my place or yours? Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does. Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope. That was the night he disappeared? Could of been. That was white people's business. And when my father was Sheriff? What about it? What was your deal with him? Will you please stop smoking? But I like to... and I don't smoke that much. Its bad for you. Ok, I will... later. You truly are a dancing fool. Yo Black, you looking for trouble. You've been losing. I'm up twelve grand today. From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty? Who told you that? Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here. How'd you know I was here? Here's another tip... What are you doing? Come on! Damn! We gotta skedaddle! I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up! Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto! Where's Tommy? Good-bye, Maxine. Whatever. Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil? Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn  As life's corners I . . . All right, let it go. . . . turn. As soon as this is over, I'm gone. Big surprise. Jail? Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right... How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition... I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking. What? You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house, What's that? This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us. Stop knowing me so well. I know it's at the high end of our range -- High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget. But it's what we want. You wanted furniture too, didn't you? They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer. You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks. You could have a pool to cool off in. It's a nice pool, isn't it? And it's a shorter commute. It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on. Yeah maybe you're right. You see how nice things are when we go slow? She's not his type. Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws. Agent... Kulok. Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face? Vegas. Vegas. Can you arrange that? There's a hole! I found a square hole! That's it -- the release lever -- look inside! I am -- it looks horrible! Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor. Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it. I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . . Yes, I guess you're right Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look? Thanks for your help. Any time. I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back? Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged... I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey. For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists -- Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman. That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open. Where are you off to? I'm going parading before it's too late! What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling. I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me... Exploring uncharted territory? Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here. It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard. I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here? Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong. I take it back. That Star Destroyer is slowing down. Good. You know all that  if these walls could talk  stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory? Actually, I do. Willam! Ronnie! How are you? You work here now? No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend. Well, id'n that nice. It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine! Again? Yes, if you like.  Call me at work. You got that, shit face? Asina... KNOCK IT OFF! Big fuckin' deal. You want my partner to kiss your ass? Would that be good enough for ya? What does this mean to you? ...I had a dream about...something like that. You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there? You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything... Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon. Were they pen pals? No. Is he some kind of celebrity or something? No. Did he do some anonymous good deed for her? The power. Mitch... Wait here. Don't move. There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it. Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no. Two of us might be more effective than one. I work alone. Get your clothes on. You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here -- Get your clothes on, lady -- GET OUT! You're under arrest. You bought this for me? Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share. Where are we going? I'm sorry.  I've got plans. Again? She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong. I'm sure you'll be very convincing. Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M. Yeah right. What?  We both have cars. Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet. That's not why we're going out. What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies? Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment. Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up? Please. Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore! You shouldn't a done that. Why? You gonna do something about it? Yeah, I'll do something. Well, I'm done.  Are you done? No -- Okay, let's go. But -- Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die. You're not gonna fucking die, all right? I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad. It's not good... Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die. I can' take you to a hospital. Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe. Lie back down, and try to - I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor. It's okay by me, peanut. Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me. What, again? Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?-- What?-- I think we'll live in Europe after we're married? I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married. You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you-- You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring-- I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think? I think we ought to walk. No. They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die! Upham? Pass. Sarge? Amber... No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head. Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving. No!  You're not tearing me loose any more. Do I have to spell it out? You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad? Bitch!  Look what you did! Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?... Are you married? Yes, sir. Any children? No, no children. All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions. Thank you very much. Next, please. Thanks, Melvin. Welcome. You happy? About what? Why you gotta make everything difficult? You too? Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop. Fuck this. I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No. Very well. O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back? Probably a year... He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years. He went dirty and they made an example of him. But he was such a good cop. They always are. Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet. It was you, Charley... . Okay  I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but  go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in. Do you see the maintenance panel? Got it. Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up. Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here. Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them? Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee... Sure, Valiant, sure... Let me got! Where are you taking me? Right here. Now sit down. Our child's safety is at stake. These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt. Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed. Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do? Don't you want me to? Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth! Okay! I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?! No. Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say. Who? Me! Hey, you were never going to give me the money. I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore. You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you? I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca. I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much? I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it. If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder? Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had. Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them... I take it she read well. It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire... How nice. In time she'll be what you are. A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice? Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning... How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody. He was... taken. He was killed. I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something. So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					* Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town. I'm shocked. Yeah.  You know Harry. Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you. Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred? A sight for sore eyes! Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there! Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds! And are the police aware you dated the victim? What are you saying? That I killed her or something? It would certainly improve your high school Q. What's the Boom Boom Room? That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town. Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good. Oh? I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston. Is that so? Yes, sir.  My father taught me. Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra... I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. ...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light. All my clothes -- That's right -- worry about your clothes -- You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons -- Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind -- Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day. Have you done your homework, honey? Yes, mom -- Then here's a little bump. Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye. Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next. Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them. Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind. And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again. I heard him say it. Then -- those are not your own words? No. What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say? He's stubborn as a Stone. Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he? You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch? I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl. And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore? I liked it when you caught me fucking him. God, can you hear me! Wha-at? Catwomen. Lots of them! Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right? Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it. Yeah, yeah, I did. Good man.  And is she all right? Yeah. Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow? Yeah. Are you all right, Barney? God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty! That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist! If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed. What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life. I'm just being realistic. At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags! I hate sports. How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out? You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity. Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that. I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you? I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right? Yeah, sure. Of course. ...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job. What about Joe? Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you. Yeah, well I like you too... Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right? Men!  Are you up for it? I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double. You mean John Bubber? I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business. Well make it your business. Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas. Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm! I better not come in. I ain't stupid. I mean it's late, baby. I know where you're going. I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest. You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful. Will you get the fuck out of here. Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal? Tommy  ... Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl! Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus. I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house. Don't lie. You don't believe me either. It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir. If I don't make it back here by ten... Yeah? ... I'd head for Cucamonga. Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now. Damn! Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant? Ask her... Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop? None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards. Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home. Yeah.  Maybe he'll call. That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard! Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away. What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed! And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door. I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day. Farrah. Come here. You're just like you mother! Always jealous! That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything! She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion. What's the matter with you? I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it -- You should meet my father. Ah, Conor, how you look a man. Have you time for some- thing to eat? What did you do today Satan? You don't care. Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love. Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK. That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down! Don't call me dumb! I mean cute dumb. Now bend over! Leia! Luke, no!  It's a trap. Oh, won't you reconsider... Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia. Why attack Russia? Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here. Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson? I have detailed files. I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything. You are the boy ... I should go That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you? Promise me she'll have her home. She does. And tell me that she's happy. Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could. Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask? Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant... Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast! Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig! Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days. Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef. Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay? Yeah, I broke my fall. All day again? Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch. ...Who? Marty. You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun. An' you won't let nobody touch me? No--an' look what I got for you. Anthony, give me the fucking gun! No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours. She's so sexy. I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging. What about Spock? I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is -- What I have done, I had to do. But at what cost? Your ship... Your son. If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul. But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin-- Yes Basil? Be careful! Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy! And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan? Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall. And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters? Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now! Well ? Fire the whole division. Excuse me, sir ? Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable. Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good.... If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ? We will start work on it now sir. How could this be happening? I don't know. We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time. Sun spot? Yeah, that's how Hams work. Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69. What if I just left? Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink. I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are. But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist? No. But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy. No, because there were others.  There were admirals. There were admirals. Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case. That's right. I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave. You saw wrong. Huh? He's with the hotel.  I called him. What are you talking about? We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it. He was wearing a suit. He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak. How come I didn't hear anything? You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me. Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart. I can't do that! That's cool. When can you leave? As soon as you want. I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling. For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst. No.  I'm just not sure what you mean. There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned. At the party. Toward the end.  You remember? Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine. Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know. Who's that? The wives. It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop. What Hurts Vada? The bee stings! I can't breathe! Disclose the information. Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet. KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION! No. Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king. What is that gizmo?! I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet. We better get word to the authorities and --  Look! You liked this woman. You used her several times. She had beautiful hands. I think you must have had a love affair with her... No, no! Just with her hands. You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I see you. I'll tear his head off. Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion? Derogatory? Yeah, he's great. The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands. Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves. Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent -- Klute offered us his services; we've accepted. Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night. That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty. No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning. Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for... I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech. Help me!  Please!!! My God, I heard something! ...all the luck in the world. You do? Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas. The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff? Why? How did you come to know their names? You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker. I don't understand... I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it? I didn't put you in Alpine Grove. No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket. Mister! Oh, shit! Don't come any closer!!! Cut it out stupid.  It's me. Ha. Maybe I should join SNL. Need to get in that building? No really? There a story in that building? Possibly. Gale Weathers would find a way. Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that. I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that? Can I keep it? What do you think? I know my rights. You don't know shit, Lebowski. I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler. What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties? Uh-huh. Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive. That guy treats women like objects, man. Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear? Not bad. Secret recipe. Mary again. Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years. Whatever happened to Mary? I told you, her family moved to Miami. I mean since then. I don't know. Well why don't you look her up? Yeah, right. Why not? Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single. What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her? I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed. So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up? I also called Unsolved Mysteries. You're kidding? What did they say? They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time. I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing. Well, it's up to Suzie. It would be nice. Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that? Around here?  Why would they? Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations... Yeah, vibrations in the ground. Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this. Hey.  Way to gut it out. Thanks, Wick. Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.? Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ... Doctor Soran? Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming. Why the hell wasn't I told about this place? Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability. What is it? A tracer. You'll like it. Thanks a million, Uncle Al! You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now. Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy? I Just want to find a suitcase. Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion. Oh dear. Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- How did you know...? There's a reward for your death. What's wrong with you? You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me. Interesting. I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter? No. Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat. I told you to cut down on the sugar. I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess. This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this. Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret. This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ... We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy. Huh? No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping. Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us -- Maybe we can catch it. Oh no...I think there's carrots in here... Send it back if you don't want it. Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut. I'm not crazy.  I'm inept. Yeah, it's like tradition or something. Right.  That gives us... Exactly three weeks to the day. What was the motive? She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there. What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? Barely. You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you? What happened? Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm. You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch? I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl. And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore? I liked it when you caught me fucking him. Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow! Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it? Who exactly ARE you? What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson. And who IS Ted Nelson? That's the way I thought of them sometimes. Berries. Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children. Will you please talk to me? Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time. Then when? I have to talk to you. Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails. Any historical figure. Okay... Ghandi. Good answer. You? Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger. How do I get there?  Tell me. That's easy.  You... You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good... But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection... Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>! Yes, the rain has been very heavy. Yes. He's not strong enough to fight off another attack. I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham. In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that... Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day. Who gives a shit about aft? That's where my boat's moored. You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do? Just trying to get to my boat... She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea. How do you know that? I don't know, I just feel it. Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either. So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here. Nikita?  She helped me find you. What?  How did you know I had a cat? Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right. Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for? I work for the government. Yeah? Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . . No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles. Peanut? We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like. Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives. Johnny Rico, you're jealous ! I can't help it. He's nothing like you. I don't even know if you're my girl. It's a film... of a girl being murdered. I'm afraid I don't... This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could. You don't know anything about me. I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch. Laura, you didn't come and see me today. I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here. A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with. I'm not. Did you make me a tape? I already made you two tapes. Laura, you have to deal with all of this. I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight. Send me a kiss. Why didn't you wait for me? We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up. That's not true. Here I am. Beatrix, I want to ask you something. You don't usually ask. I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service. Oh dear God... What is 'fisting'? But I understand what you mean. You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon. Sounds boring to me. Don't come. You know how many demerits we're talking? So don't goddam come!  Please. All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught. Well, no shit, Sherlock The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it? Absolutely. Good hunting. Hayes out. Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp. Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus. It's an honor. Please.  Come.  Sit. Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave? I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew. Where's Laurie? I don't think she's coming with us. Spock? Welcome aboard, Captain. He'll weasel out of trouble. Again. Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though. Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it? What do we do? We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot. Hank? Yes. You want to come splash around. I'm just warning you, I can't swim. Get -- the -- bug -- off! Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that! What'd you all talk about? Pearl and John. John and Pearl! Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life... Quite a piece of plumbing. Over. We found one. I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me. Oh yeah? Sabotage? I don't understand... I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub? You have no right to blame Duval -- That line was tampered with... I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession. You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind... I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident. Two in a row? It's possible -- I don't know what to tell you, Skip. Tell me one thing. With a hack-hack here -- And a slash-slash there -- Hi Suze. I'm working on it. I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening? ...He wasn't listening to the right thing... What do you listen to, Stephen? You don't know... nobody knows... I might. Early night for you, isn't it? I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all. Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember: Scale the -- Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready? Oh no. Like for you to look for the man. Grunemann? I've looked at him a -- Oh, Rufus! All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head. Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say. I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something. Ernie, they're calling from work. Tell me I'm on the way in. It's Paul. We only owe the King a hundred and fifty. We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King. Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this? An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator. How does it work? With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA. No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley. Where have you been hiding? Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you. Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick? So you washed it off! How about giving me another coat? Good-by. Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court-- Good-by! There's soft music-- --sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board. Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board. You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett. Doc. Nice to meet you. Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five. Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View... You sold eight Mountain View? You bet your ass.  Who wants to go to lunch?  Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying.  Eighty-two fucking grand.  And twelve grand in commission.  John.  On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads. What did he do? He hit a guard. What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do? We're not going to do anything. They're going to kill us! They can't shoot us in here. Can't talk right now. See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail. How long have you been running this place? How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long. I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard. An occupational hazard, I'm afraid. I bet.  Going into people's homes. It's a living. What do you want? Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman. Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy? Oh boy, I'd love it. I'm going after those horses. I'll take the camels. I don't need camels. But, Indy -- No camels! How's the job coming, Bob? Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff. We'll see about that ... He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director. Well, he certainly isn't acting like it. That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player. Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino. I wouldn't do that, son. They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy. Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate. Who is it? It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants? Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business -- We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian. Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian. Doesn't matter. Move on. You know Bill is really mad at you. Oh? I mean... Mary? What do I have to do? I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers. I don't like flowers. Oh. How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them. Kay. Okay. Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery. Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom? Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of. Ah, but you have heard of me. I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help. The Widow of the Web? Yes. That creature helps no one. And none who go there return. She has the power of vision. She has the power to kill. Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name. Her name is Death. She had another name once. I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo. It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it. I know, but we're on a college campus... This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival. No, I don't think that at all.  How is he? They wouldn't let me... Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe? Send for Goebbels. A habitu  of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years. Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on. The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman... Yes? Well worth the dig! I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine. Stand up. I said I'm fine. First time in a grav couch? Yes. Thanks, Healy. Good work. Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project? Uh, that's okay. You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy! I didn't mean to hurt you. Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. You what? You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease. There's no disease, I can tell you. Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you? I'm glad you do. There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death. Dorothy. No! If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. You called me Jeffrey. I did. Are you? Yes. Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK. No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright. So how are you really doing, Panes? Why don't you go fuck yourself? No.  Really.  For real.  Really. I'm worried about your Galiano. You're a shit. No, really, five thousand with your discount. I'll settle for L.A. County. Row twenty-three, section C. Okay. What's her name? Betty. What's she like? Okay. I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ... Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ... Reclaim my birthright, y'mean? Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ... It's why the witch kills children. I thought all witches were benign and good. Not this one. We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time. I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain. Do it. They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared. If you need help... Yes. I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary. I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor. Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have? Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it? Yes, of course. I'll get it for you  While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net. Sounds like a rough one. Got a better idea? So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother. Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio. Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something? Go ahead, whatever it's worth. How much is there? Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise. Have you thought about a wife?  A family? No. I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know. I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when. Accept what's happened, Michael. I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me. No, I wanted other things for you. You wanted me to be your son. Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America. Then why have I become a man like you? You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice. A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that. What else do you believe in? Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne. It's a fine spot, ma'am. He thought so, yes. Who was that on the phone? Wrong number. You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace? We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda! Stop blaming yourself. So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow. And...? And, take some more pictures. Wow, you are smart. And you are great in bed. Pretty girl. If you like 'em like that. You got types? Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws. Who is she? I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side. By the way, how is your father's side? Much better, thanks. How many drinks have you had? Six Martinis. Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me. You're not dumb. I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain. What's this in favor of? I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you. But... why? Why would you pretend? I can't tell you. You don't trust me? I don't trust anybody. And you want me to do you some big favor? Maybe I ought to think about getting another job. Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch. Tell it to my daughter. Shit... fuck procedure. Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron! I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do. Got it. I need the main wet-wall. Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport. What are you talking about? I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty! You're back. Yeah. I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad. Angela, I just heard Sal was alive. Sure. Why not. Where? Where is he? Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up. You talk to him? Oh, sure... Twice a day. What hospital is he in? Where? Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing. Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way. He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick! No witnesses of any kind? None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out. Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee... Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest. I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish... Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is. No, please, not again. ...you, Mason? Yeah, yeah... Oh, Jesus. I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today. Don't even do it, ya bastard. He got beat up by a girl. If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes. Adam, that's not true! Yes, it is. Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do. If I don't move, I can't shoot it. Let it go, Peter.  The animal won. Friends and <u>colleagues</u>. You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ... Poor baby. I hope it's the right kind. Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me! How long has it been? A goodly length in times past, but lately No, no. You have a wife, children Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II? No, I didn't. It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic. Me too. Who are you and what are you doing here? I need one hundred thousand dollars. Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you? Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox. That depends. On what? Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It's quite out of the question. The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man? Like Job? Ah, but, we're asking about you. I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed. Why, may I ask? That's the question I want to ask Job. I don't know Job any more than he knows me. Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. Why should I? Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location. It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits. Mm - Hmmm... Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car? Very good. Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first. A group of us are going out tonight. Who? Guzman, Tomas, Esteban -- Your new friends. Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come? Not this time. No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end. But we heard him. It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself. You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK? Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up. I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles. You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner. I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms. Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take. What did he mean by Huxley? What is it? The good doctor signed our death warrant. You want me to dress like her? Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you. Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead! Judy -- It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead? Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon. Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility? Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK. That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore. Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out. I only did it once and... I see.  How much? Forty-five all total. Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty? Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up. What's she doing? I think she's about to foal. So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before. He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece. Free? Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels. Well, don't let me keep you from anything. I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind? It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too? Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up. What list? Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in. Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter and stick by it? Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe. Ten years. What happened!? I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer. Thank you. His home would be... Mount Olympus. Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed. Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you. I can't wait. Well, promise then. What do you mean - now? Of course now. Right away, before I get any older. What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word. I can't write this anymore. Don't be silly. Of course you can. I'm telling you, I can't. You can--you have the "gotta"-- The what? The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta. I said that? You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you. Oh, Rocky! Christ. You didn't! She's not responding... Try the emergency channels... Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant. Picture, Mr. Saavik. Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married? Because I love her. What can I tell you? Benny, there's nothing there. There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses. Flew?! Oh, come on Benny... Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you. You were a lady in distress, weren't you? What? Oh - uh - nothing. What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs -- Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look. Okay then... Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that? I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think? Not me. But other people seem to. Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it. Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you? No... Actually, you look more like a cop. What did you see? I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene? Everything. It is a ghastly existence. Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold. The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode. Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?! I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me. Must you use that awful word? Cunt. Stop it. Cunt. I said stop it. Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation? WHY? Yes. But surely you know...? It's against my better Judgment... Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late? I've done all I could with the laser. All I'm asking is you test it beforehand! If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests. Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser. I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final! As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake. I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise. Jeff you have company! Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you. I'm sorry, Claudia. What is it?  Did you forget something? No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date. You wanna go on a date with me? Please, yes. Well...is that illegal? No. Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do? I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door. Really? Yeah. I thought you were flirting with me a little. How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at? What are you talking about! I'll do it, Jake. No way.... It's my fault...I have to.... We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me.... Jake. I'm the one who wanted to study it.... Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south. You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes. Moon's too bright. It was crazy not to have destroyed them That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately. And what of these foreigners? I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret. Four? There are five. Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count. Is she... dead? No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite. We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her? We'll find it. Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago. Heading true north.  We continue in that direction. Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course. We'll trust in faith, Gump. Aye, lad... we've little else to go by. Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now. Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh. He's not here. We're getting divorced. Gee. I'm sorry to hear that. You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me? Yeah -- Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that! Frances... Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it! You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK? Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up. I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles. You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner. I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms. God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him. Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him. What was that? His horse. This is a Rolex, I can't take it. Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane. No I'm not. Hasn't anyone ever told you that before? Let's talk about something else. What would you like to talk about. I don't know. Anything... may I sit down? Yes. He's got those love handles. I don't have love handles. You promised justice. If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I? People have put their trust in you. They have done nothing of the sort. Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise? It's boring, isn't it? I can sit through it once. He thinks he's Joe Gunn now. I'm impressed. He knows a lot. He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am. I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me! Nick, I love you -- JESUS CHRIST! What did you tell him about the baby? That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me. And you turned him down?? Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. Well, good luck there, Tracy Thanks, Mr. M. Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something .. No, you didn't. Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump .. No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll. We're going. Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime. Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while? I found the pentacle. Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song. We're on the move. C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk! How's everything? Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend. Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods. Oh, yeah. But I go nuts.  It's a conflict. Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front... I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed! It's not going to help us! We're going to die here! We're going to die! What is your problem? I can't do this. Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved. Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing? I've been told that before. Kip's another one. One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire. Looks like it took out the backup genny too. Mordant, go with them and report back to me! You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave-- I think we're going to need them. Blast it! Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something. Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand. Schulz, you're off your nut! Give me the radio. We have no radio. All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see. This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge. How are you, Rhian? So? So, we need to get to the source. We are lost. No, it will turn out well. How will it? I don't know, it's a mystery. Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon. This way. Oh no. Like for you to look for the man. Grunemann? I've looked at him a -- Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings. What's it say? It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through. Something wrong, Cobb? Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir... What's wrong with it? ...I'd really have to show it to you. All right... What!? We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you? You killed him. That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved. Is that all right with you? Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth. 78. I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else! You're going too fast. But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way... Tell me. They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you. You, kill me? Eliminate you. Where are you going? To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him. Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament? They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted. There's worse places. Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well. You've got a beautiful walk, Bob. Let's go. First we're flying -- now we're sinking! Well, come on! Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight. But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you. You understand which side the gelatin's on? It tastes wonderful! You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit. Andy! No! I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down. I thank you. And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am. I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get. ... no... He's better off this way. Nobody's better off this wav! You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour. What the hell took so long. Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long. Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not. Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded? <u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake. How many came back? About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third. ...That's what's important. I don't know what you're talking about. You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease -- Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance... Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ... Sure. By shooting at me. Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ... I don't even know your name yet ... My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it. What part of Dixie are you from, Duane? Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen. We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case. I'm not going near any lifeboat! But Rennie... I'm not!! That's it.  I'm out of here. For Christ's sake, Dude. Where are you from originally? Around here. the valley? Hollywood, mainly. And what did your parents do? My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian. Why does that sound silly? Well I guess it doesn't. Does you mother still work? She's retired. Are you close? She's my mother. What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy. Go Get 'Em, Honey. And your father? He passed away. I'm sorry. people die. I wouldn'tve asked -- Not a problem. And you ended up at UC Berkely -- From '84 to '89. Psychology major? Right. Do you have your masters? ...this close... In five years? Second thing this week I can't explain. What was the first thing? Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow. Sounds like a virus. No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything. It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress. I can go to the bar. Don't leave me. Those guys bother you? No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here. C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion. I'm a little tired, I don't know if... Get in the car! I don't believe you. You don't believe me? Okay, fine. Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape? Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A. Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig. I can come visit? You better! Yes! I will. It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs. Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game. Same here. You can retire my number. You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy! Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months! Months? I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways. I'm lonesome already. Stop fooling around... I need to talk. What's the matter? I don't know... I just feel scared. About what? The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party... I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right. Before or After I have my nervous breakfown? C'mere. Dad. I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while? I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia. Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom. I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna -- These are yours. Not according to Mrs. Rabinow. Hold your course. Look sharp... At what. I finished my book. How did it end? I told you.  She kills him. Hello, Rex. Marylin. Are you alright? You lost weight. My whole metabolism is -- off. Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town? Keep counting Claire. Yeah -- ? Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven? Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them! I thought there were people here.... I'll go look.... You were saying... Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that? What the hell's going on? Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with- Reilly, what're you doing here? And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said. And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and... And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer. ...yes...? But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all. When? But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...? Do you believe in him, Verbal? Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE. You think that's going to work? I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything. Safety on? Yeah. This way. Sun's gettin high. Deers have ears too. Psychiatrists make you nervous? Just ones this beautiful. The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off? On occasion. Usually at night. Who's that? That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please. You got the schematics? Everything. And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here! I must ask for that back. I want to know who is responsible for this treatment. Yes, sir! We aren't barbarians. Yes, sir! Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten? I don't know, sir. You will dine with me from now on. Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder. I think it's beyond what you'd call dating. You going to get married? Maybe. You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy? Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man-- Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse. Don't hang up! <u>What</u>?... Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby? Where do you think babies come from? From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know. Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes. It's over now. I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future. Do we have a future? Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened. Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone. Will the cathedral be finished soon, John? Yes, very soon. Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening. Oh yes! It was wonderful! I'm glad, John. Goodnight. You guys got something going on downstairs? We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community. Basement bingo? How? Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior. Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs. No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd. Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya. Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's - What'd he say? Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' - His wife? Linda. No. Linda Cooksey? No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone. So... they didn't... No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems. Oh. Oh, my. Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now. Oh. Geez. Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her. Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise. Hey - these are real diamonds. Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back. Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings. Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore. Who is he? What have you got me into? It's just you and me, then. Come here, might as well fix that arm. Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living. ... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater? Or a vegetarian? Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison. Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it. What are they? Why don't he just tell 'em the truth? He knows nobody wants to hear the truth. As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart. But I still want one. Yes -- .... But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it. He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place. Hi, it's me. I'm still here. I'm so glad. I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis. And you will.  But not now. I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning. I told you, he had to go out on a case. They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind. What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio? Is he supposed to look like that? No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still... The monster appears to be a genetic aberration... No fuckin' lie... ...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality... Gee, I can't. Why not? You went farther than that last time. I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids. Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn. Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I -- Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up? I don't know.  I never used a gun. Really? You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way. You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks. No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about. I know what you're talking about. You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute. Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn? Of course not. Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em. Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house. It's a big house. Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up. When did you see him last? September '39. Hey... so, what brings you down here? I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh... What are you trying to say? It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out. I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke? No. What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this? Mr. Lipnik, I   I apologize, Barton. No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help   You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business. Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider   Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts. Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts. They would have killed this man? People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army. How long will that take? They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2. Bandit I, do you copy? This is Bandit I, come back. How would you know sh... I live.  In the same country. It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do. Yeah, all right, listen... So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.... What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this? Undercover. I thought so. Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch. You go first. I'll be right below you. Your arm, you can't... I can.  We can do this... Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh? Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow? Just one? Yeah. I like the gym smell. Now take your panties off. You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today. Great. What's the latest we can get there? About two-thirty. Okay. Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend? Yup. Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important? Yup. You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly. What's stopping you? Hey, how'd my car get here? I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam. Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right. I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present. What? And you think I'm sick? Why are you laughing? I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you. That doesn't hurt. But sometimes I cried a lot too. I didn't. I just waited. Want to cry now? Dil! Get that thing off me, Fergus -- Have we met? No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer. Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!? There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is? That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know. I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead. I have to stay. No! Sit down now. I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins. Scientologist. Oh. I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'? Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself? There's a way to get a guy's attention. My mission in life. Do I have to do everything around here? I hope so. What is it? Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it... And who, Rose, may I ask, is that? Well, it's Billy. And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here? Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go. Well, it was a silly question. He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman. Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes? Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you? We're the experts. Who trusts experts? I'm your future husband, remember? I have no future husband. I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing. Hi honey. Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler. So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again? Fine, Bob. How are you? Never better. Really? I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank. Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator! Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty. I understand, sir. Why? Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me. I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him? No.  All you need is to want to be the best. You're the best, Enzo! That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there... Just tell me where it hurts, baby. What? I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think? Continental Casualty... Mr. Alito, please. Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch... I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number? I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed... ...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him... I can't guarantee that... I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent. My...mother...? Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate - But my mother...  Ellie said she died - I under5tand.  All the same -Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when - I had you sent away. Who the hel1 - It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great - What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?! A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer - When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!! Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the - I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?! I thought everything WAS arranged. Well, there's a problem. What problem? Who's Principal Collins? The principal. Wow. Sure! Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something? Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father. No problem, is it at your place? Yeah. And you believe this law with all your heart and soul. And mind, yes.  What are you -- So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch. I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight. Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive? Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed. She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb. Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas? Nah, man... You sure you're comfortable? Yeah.  Are you sure? Yeah. Me too. Okay.  Did you bring a condom? Yeah, right here. Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue. Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent. Wade? C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here. Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories. Right.  Like last night's doozie. I know what I saw. And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story. Come on in... Alan. Alan Bailey. Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going? No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws. Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue. What's this? A cockaroach? A spider.  Eight legs. Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain. ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN. Why don t you let me take this one, Kenny? Okay, chief. That's because he doesn't have one. Whata you mean?  He told me - Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is. What's to stop him from just ripping me off then? That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme. If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do. Tell me... Tell the king to give me more men. July of '71. About the past year. They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm. I can't hold up my head anymore. I'll go encode your room key. Thank you. Sure, Dave -- Please, Dil -- It's the President, for Christ's sake! I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man. I haven't changed anything.  Damn. I... I've got to take a piss. What the hell is it? In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light. What'd you dream about? Nothing. Come on, what was it? Nothing.  It was just a dream. It feels warm. One more shot? Okay. We still have to get out of here. Maybe if we gave the tapes back -- Yeah...You've fallen for her. I told you, I have a feeling... One of your instincts? I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her. Ready?  What is it? Ummm -- figure eight? Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you? No.  They're just coming to me. Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up. What about that shit about Vietnam! Dude, I'm sorry-- What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?! I don't know.  I'm not sure. Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible? Yes.  I suppose it's possible. Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air. Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction? I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this. Let me do it for you, Mr. White. It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement. They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights. The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner. I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone. I love you. Come home. I want you to have this. What is it? It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin. I don't believe in luck. Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home. Thank you. John . . .? Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant. What about you, Mrs De Moraes? I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard. Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan? Perhaps it wasn t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know. Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The  1,000. You gave it to him in cash? Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ? Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young.... His mother? What? I don't know. Nothing. You know what they say about men who need big guns... Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet. Down boy. Who you callin' "boy? Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you? We're square. Thanks, man. You need anything, you call. Thanks. You rode? You think Jade Fox will show up? She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl. It's good to see you. What seems to be the problem? Women. That, sir, does not compute. First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else. Specify, please. Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file. Coming on line now, sir. You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie. What's the hurry ? Others are waiting. Holy shit - Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in? Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me! Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you... You're no bargain either, pal. I want my mommy...I want my mommy.. Don't start, Farmer. It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving. The chauffeur. He's watching. He deserves a show. He missed the movie. I'm serious, Frances. This is important. I know. Anything? No. Munich's a bust. He's loose. Are we locked up? Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want. You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy. I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right? Well, at least you still talk the same. So who changes? But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist? That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it! You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros. Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks. Miss you, Walt. He said it for us all, Walt. What do you drink? Bourbon? Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that? Neil, do you mind? Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf! Deb, we're pretending to be hookers. Right in here. The big show starts in one minute. Come in, 007. You know the Minister? Of course.  Minister Johnstone. Is *your* father dead? Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver. *Liver* killed him? *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death. But did you know him? Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him. Did you know your mother better? She's dead now, too. She was a nanny. What's a nanny do? She looks after other people's children. Did you grow up around here? No. She was an immigrant. What's an immigrant? Someone not from Maine. What's the matter -- restless? Yes, people make me restless. Even women? There aren't any women here. I suppose that's your wagon in the river. Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on. And you're all alone. Yeah. We closed. Fantastic.  Out here. The Ottawa are gone. Why did they turn back? Maybe. Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom. A secret, I like that. This is it I guess. Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door. You want me to come with? I should do this myself. Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around. Okay. Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed. And John? Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims. I don't understand. The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact. What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>. It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell? He helped me out once.  That's all. Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing. Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>. Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself <u>What do you want</u>? Wendell, I want you to come to work for me. Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn? And you're too young. I'm the same age you were when you went off to war. And the same age Web was. No. Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help. For what? Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working... I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around -- You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself. Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't. Then one day they find you. They open a window. Did you know him before you knew Dad? Since seventh grade. Did you catch that thunder? No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll. I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself. What? His name is Robert Paulson! No! And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you? Yes. --And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you? Yes. --and that he changed his will? Yes. You wish you hadn't blown the whistle? There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it. Whadaya doin', there's no one there! I saw 'em! I saw 'em. Where's the news department at this studio? It's upstairs. Have you ever been there? Sure, why? I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments? I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour -- Ok. All right, okay, let's talk. In Breslau. Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now. Hey! What the  --  ! The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to. Really? I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen... Well. He said to "make the house mine. Oh boy. If he only knew. Yeah. I guess. You know -- SAW WHO!!? The Red Knight! The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you? So what's up?  What'd I miss? She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality. So? It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive. Nice neighborhood. Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real. George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there. Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now. I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end. Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this? The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened? Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. Like a New Year's Day hangover. He needs to be turned over. No, man. I want you to have it. Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails. Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble. It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure. Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it? No problem. A star is born. - every day. Hot damn, Clarice. He knew her...! Just give me a hint, all right? All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this. See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes. Must be. And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared. Is it Cartman's mom? Very funny! Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him. But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...? All you have to do is stop talking and just listen. But how do you know what you hear is the truth? I don't know it.  I feel it. You make it sound so simple... The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated. Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?! So... even you don't believe in me anymore... Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone... Where was that, Florence, huh? Firenze. Do you like being a cop, Bud? I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective... I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out. He ain't the problem, Jack. Cordon off the area. Something came through. From where??!! Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road! That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion. Where's Ratan? Who? Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him -- Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me. When did you start drinking coffee? Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it. You left me to die, friend. You managed alright. Is this what's left of your army? Where'd you get all this? I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal. You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job? It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life! We gotta get back soon... Birdy... I didn't mean to-- What'd he say? Birdy... David, I don't understand... I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it -- Better re-load it. You missed him? You didn't...? I got him. Ah, Venice... Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him? I don't know. Maybe he'll know us. How much? I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten. You think it's that good? I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got. Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me? Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit. Shaddup bitch. How is it now? Seems to be back to normal, sir. How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts? Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide. A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing. You're sure of that? Yes.  I am. Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes? Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions? You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious. It's their Presidential Suite. Great. I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes.... Mmm.Hmm. You see? Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold. I'm sick. Stay that way. I'm sick and I'm in love. You seem the sort of person who confuses the two. That's right.  That's the first time you're right.  I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE. We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system. Go! I'm serious. We didn't just have sex in the bathroom? No. Get in, Mom! I have to open. This is so silly. Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko... I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury. Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet. Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there. Get out of there   take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing. What's the matter with my printing? It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes. Thank you. That's right? I've never met anyone like you in my life. She's right?! I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. No. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life. But what about us? We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. And I said I would never leave you. And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now... I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere. I really should get home... Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank! You want to tell me what the hell's going on? Huh? I just saw a man walk out of your room. Uh ... In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency. Decency?  Hey listen, pal ... No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias. Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank. Charles! What's up, man? Oh. You know. Did you, um, did you get that pilot? No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway... ...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East. After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors. Aye, sir. I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer... Understood, sir. Dismiss the company. Do you mind if I borrow it? Not at all, if it can help. Brad! I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people... You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say. Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do. What's the lighthouse? It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know.... Great.  I got some wine. Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number-- I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward. Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS. We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick. You must have had fun. You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up... Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he? He certainly -- hic -- does! These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau. Jesus... As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction. Thank you. Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform. Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her. Shhh, my head hurts. I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you. Why did you help me? It doesn't matter. I hear you're helpin' Verona. Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend* You and Verona? What?  We took bathes together when we were kids. Would you like a cigarette? No, thank you. They stain my fingers. B-3. Miss.  G-6. Ohhh!  You sunk it! Heh-heh. Are you peeking? Oh, quit your whining and pay up. What are you talking about? Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find. D'Artagnan, unready? At a ball, everyone watches the King! Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please. A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur? Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James? No! What gave you that idea? Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room. She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic. Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way. Wait! I know how we can get in! Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it. But... my plan involves all four of us acting together. See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later. Lemon? Sure. I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild! But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite. Dinner, Hubert. I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed. We're waiting, Hubert. David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed! Goodnight. Hope I'm not interrupting...? What does he want? Newt.  Newt, wake up. Wah...?  Where are...? Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble. I don't know any other way, Annie. Why? How do I look? You look very good. Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it. Chill out Edgar. -- he's a vampire. You're joking -- What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway? Louis, we were French! That's different!  What's the matter with you? So. So. We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me, No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline. The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first. Then you know where Jacqueline is? But I'd give a great deal to know. Why? I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much. I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's -- The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine? It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet. It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay. Yeah? I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend. Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays. Oh.  Okay.  That's okay. Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"? Chinatown street gang. Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman. -- The Nazi he knifed? Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment. You didn't think much about that before. Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that. Can you fill me in here? Sure.  We have no idea what's going on. Thank you. Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton. You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless. What're we going to do?! There's got to be another way out. Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected. Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed. Right. What's his name, Letty? I didn't say... You provoke me, Merlin. What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake. He must have left another puzzle piece. Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh... This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday. Decide to take a day off after all? Dad, I want to see Rod Lane. My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master? Sounds like a game show host to me. No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up. Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number? Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem. Alright! Could take a little while, though. What's a "little while? Two.. maybe three days. What? Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny. Why? I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice. Maybe he's scared of the dark. Are you? Poor William! What indignant tears! There, there... shhh... I only wish there were something I could do for you. But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil. Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning. Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings. M'mm. Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest. Thanks. Yes. No one else in there with you? Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there... Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy. She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her? *You* taught her, I suppose... That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she? Where are the guards? The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous. No wire. Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in. Let the party begin. Have enough fun for the both of us. Oh, don't be such a victim. When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers. I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye. Kay, I told you... Goodbye, Michael. I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave. Michael. No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE! Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again? If that's what it takes; then yes, I will. At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has. We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children. You haven't heard me. Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain. We're your customers. We're not complaining. Please! What are you doing? Trying to save your ass so you can save the world. You get your first palm tree in South Carolina. How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that? I read it. Shee-it. You believe all you read? Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly... They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too. Yes, sir. Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here. Mr. Bixler,  I love you. Oh, Vada... I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here. Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you. No he wouldn't, I can't go home. I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it. Yeah, well he did, didn't he. Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought-- I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye. I just want you there in case there's trouble. And if there is, then Zero can kill someone? We'll see. You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him. I have to go. Wrong. I have to go. He sighs. I know. What's that? Devil book. The Unix Bible. Someone s after me. Then we must call the police. No.  I mean...  that isn t necessary. Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary. Yes, it is. Well ... thanks.  Bye. Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois. Elois? Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E. Where was she from, Compton? No. She was from Ladora Heights. Look at you... You want to go. For what? A couple hundred bucks? I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush. It's what I do. It's my job. Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something? Are you asking me if I have something to prove? Do you have something to prove? Not in that repressed anger sort of way. I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option. Good quality porn has it's place in the world. Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this? I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it. It's more than that. Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would. So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass? No. You have another part? You'll know what to do. How do you know I will? Intuition. How did you survive? I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I ve never told anyone that. I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub. A ring.  I wanted a ring. You did? You don't believe me. Oh sure. Then why are you smiling like that? Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious. You think I'm like that? How'd it go? He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first. So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you? Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there. You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement. You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children. If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to-- I didn't tell anything, I told the truth. You version of it. There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life. We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries. It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never-- InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it. All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together-- Look! There it is! What? Who? Serious, that's what's important to you? Yes, that's what's important to me... Mary again. Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years. Whatever happened to Mary? I told you, her family moved to Miami. I mean since then. I don't know. Well why don't you look her up? Yeah, right. Why not? Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single. What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her? I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed. So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up? I also called Unsolved Mysteries. You're kidding? What did they say? They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time. I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing. My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once. What's Early been in jail for? Carryin' a gun. ...Anything else? An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said. Jeez... Adele! Shit, maybe he'll kill you. What? When he finds out. What? Bobby killed a guy. What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody. You want to see... See what? Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now. No, just a drill. A drill, what are you up to? Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you? Yeah. And a fifty foot extension lead? You don't have fifty foot of apartment! Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka. ...Oh, Jesus. ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave? That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann. Mm. Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife! Hey, you didn't pay me! How do I know you were gonna show us one? You're such a baby. All right, here. How long? Five minutes.  Maybe six. You're fishing. You don't know shit. I know about Esparza. Thank you. I'll bet you need to -- Yes. Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it. He's seen both of us now. Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught. What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun. Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement. My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room. Yes, what? What you were saying.  Keep talking. What was I saying? You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit. Yes, it's quite possible. You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit? My God, you've grown up. We leave in the morning?! Yes, miss. I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild! That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two. You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games. It mattered, Mom. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy. I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight. I'll be the judge of that. Hey, Gallagher! Yeah? How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach? It'll be ready in a minute. Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job. Sorry, boss  Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all. Yeah. A glorified doormat. Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it. He's so damn cocky.  This is different. It's a bluff, Vince. You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got. Yeah. What do you think?  Heart attack? You know what they say about men who need big guns... Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet. Down boy. Who you callin' "boy? Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery? N-no...I mean...you bet. I knew it. Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know. ...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to. But in your opinion, would I definitely go? How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie. What the hell is going on? Pool on the roof must have a leak. It got him.... Why'd you come out here? Why'd you take the boat? Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is... The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath? Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please. A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur? If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me. Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister. You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there. Might at least have left me my pants! Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and... No police. But, Senor-- No police!  Wait until I'm gone. Senor, you need a doctor. No police! Don't be such a baby. I can't take him. It's regular. Okay? I could stand something regular. I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good. Amazing you made it this far. Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows? Suzie Toller is missing. How many did you put on that time? All of it. There's no more left? The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy. They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees. Excellent! Number two. Greenly. Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me. With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are? No. Does she know where she's going? Rather touchy, aren't they. I thought you knew this person. Lung cancer? Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately. William Schuman.  Old Shoe.  U.S. Army.  Serial number, 21-31-2841-262. Take ten. Jesus, we're trapped! Ju... No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating! Sometimes I do.  Like for two months. ... weeks. Where did you learn how to drive like this? Like what? You need a COAT! Ash, you've gotten me enough -- No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat! It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean. Uncommon, too. I imagine so. It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. A man should have a hobby. It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it. Is your time so empty? Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing. You go out... with friends? Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you? Only my share. Where are you going? I don't mean to pry... I'm looking for a private island. What are you running away from? Why do you ask that? No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch. Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps. I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore. You should... mind it. Oh I do... but I say I don't. If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again. Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill. She sounded strong... I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left. Except you. A son is a poor substitute for a lover. Why don't you go away? To a private island, like you? No, not like me. It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness. Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace... What do you think of him? Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time. You go to school together? No, we never did that Oh -- We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him? Well, I really think he's got a chance. You do? Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new. He ain't really new. He is to a lot of people. He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago. You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority. Where are you from? Southern California. You always live there? Spent time in Arizona. Why? Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars? I know a couple. No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who? Ah... Peter Finch. Who? Peter Finch -- he's English. I never heard of him. Name somebody else. Ryan O'Neal. You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them? Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff. I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something? Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here. I'll be dammed. O'Reilly! Yes, sir? Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns... One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight? Yes, dammit, and... Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky. Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades! I beg your pardon? Take a long walk on a short pier. Have a nice day. Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo. JOEY! What...? Tell me why I miss him. He's dead? That's right. He's dead. Tell me why. How should I...? Tell me why he's dead. Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible. Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here. Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em. I don't know anybody. Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision. Well, he knows a little about me. You didn't tell him your name, did ya? I told him my first name, and where I'm from. What is Bruce doing ? I don't know..... Didn't you forget something? What? Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ... You got my note! Well ... yes ... You've come to rescue me? Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ... I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ... ...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf. Practice enough this week, you prick? And at the... Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine! Jesus, I didn't say it was. Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights. He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own. He wanted more than that. I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it. That's not going to help. I'm going to work this week...I mean it. It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash? I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it. Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand? Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess. How? If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can. That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. Hot chocolate. What? Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do. And a slice of pecan pie, right? And some pecan pie. You don't need to be here. What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you? Now let's have a drink. Right here in church? Communion. I can put them in a good school. Any school you want. And get someone to help around the house. Yup. Oh my God.  Oh my God. You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you. I didn't do it -- I didn't do it. Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it? This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing... That's how you met me. In passing. What? Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years? Now wait a minute, wait a minute... I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson. Why, Cyril, you're insane  No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer  Cyril! Perfectly absurd. And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish. What're you doing? Better safe than sorry. Spooky. Spear. What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?! They shot him in his library. I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny? Nobody.  At least not yet. And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me? Gone.  Not a trace. Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper! I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are. I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more. Gotta go, man. 280, 290, 300 knots. 3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go! You go. I'm staying with it. I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE... Then make sure he gets put away for longer. How? Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye. Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know. So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography. Right- We find the man and then we dissect him- Like a bug. But with compassion and insight-- Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness. What's wrong with him? Plenty. I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set. Some example you set. Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing. Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed. Anything really wrong with your papers? They're forged. Why? The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia. This is no time to celebrate! Just keep your eyes on the road.   How curious ... Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out. God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me. What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard? Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls. You just gonna leave 'em? What should I do? Call the cops? Cops don't do nothin. Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once. You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them. How? I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em. God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue. I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that. You're not much with girls, are you? Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it. No, I don't -- Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing. Is Simone back to earth yet? Not quite. I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby? Impossible. I just read somewhere -- I know.  I know.  They'll say anything. -- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon -- Still champions. Panes is not on your team anymore. Leave my daughter alone. Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand... What do you know of my husband? I know he left you behind. My husband is a very courageous man. Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night. How you doing, Cato? Not bad. What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be? Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once. I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine. Sorry about your game. It happens, right... This is ridiculous. How long would their shields be down? Hey, Skip. Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday... That's all right. What's on your mind? Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it. These aren't just... I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way. A through H is correct. Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state. Check. Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens. Be reasonable, please.... Forget it, he won't listen. Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English. No. I will find you. Do not.  Promise me. Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend. Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client. He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there. How are the parental units functioning these days? Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much. I don't know. Dad seems a little weird. Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth. It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there. But why would they --? You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much. She's only fourteen... ... acts like she's thirty-five. Much better. I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept? Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is. Who? The killer. You do? Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next. Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go. There are other plays... Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards... Bill, how do you do? Pleased to meet you. Pleasure to meet you. George?  What do you know about cocaine? I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive. No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty. So that's the one you want to marry. With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly. That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece. Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long. No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream. On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ... Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep. No, there's another point I want to iron out. Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow. Shelly, the Machine, Levene. You... That's great. Thank you, George. Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl? The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise. Well, it can really only go two ways. That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk. Junk? You know... it's parts... I know what junk is. Yeah? We definitely want it to have junk. Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready. It's on. ...it's definitely on. Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ... Sure. By shooting at me. Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ... I don't even know your name yet ... My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it. Yes. You have what I asked for? I do. Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left. We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams. Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for. I wonder how he did it? Did what? I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think? How's Zander? OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him. I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs? It was self-defense. Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too? Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY! Worse... you're in Texas. Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red! I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time. This came for you, sweetie. Ah! It's from State! Oh my God! You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work -- It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is. Then make your choice. I will. And I choose -- As you observed, a primitive Culture. Yes. Admiral, may I ask you a question? Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question? Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth... You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period. For example? So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist. Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies. All right. What's the scoop? On what? The passionate one? Yes. Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow. I count my blessings. Well, I guess I'll be seeing you. I'm in as long as we're careful. Knox? He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it. What stuff? Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you. Someone will come. Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead. Why would you do such a thing? No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh... I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel. You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes. What are you on about? The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly. Must I hear this? There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother. And this gives worth to butchery? It was not butchery. What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest? I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it. Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want? To avenge his father, and the others. But, why?  Tell me why. I call that a perfect day. A perfect night. Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug. Hm.  We should do it again. Just every once in a blue moon, you know. Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper? Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors? Not as a rule. They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns! Forgot your keys -- That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that. Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel. And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel. Will you lighten up, please? One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me. In Washington... What? Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado... ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay? No, it's fine.  I'm fine. Really big bed. Want a drink? Vodka? You never tasted the stuff? Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again. But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them? We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof. But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.? C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back. I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight. I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you. Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country. That's the spirit. Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do? We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle. Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive. No, Mrs. Lampert. But no one actually saw him die. No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington. Oh. Then who's this one? I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you? Me? Why me? You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies. Agents. What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want? I want my car. You got the money? The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer. It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you. And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio. These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money? Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more. You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know. That's between you and yourself, Norma. You think I made that up about the gun... They all know you? Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it? I'll meet you on the turnpike. I'm scared. And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen. Amen. Mitch? Mitch. So I was replaced by Mitch? No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch... Truman, that was our house! I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us. Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own! I think I'd like a little company. You've been well? Yes. You? Getting by. Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is. Oh, excuse me. Now left and that's it in front of you. Good. Harry -- I'm blind! Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself. Just be yourself. Always good advice. For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us. How did he get over there? Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal. Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit! That's far out! This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha! That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do? He lied to me again. You're the only one I can trust. The only one who understands what this me-... ...-m-means, Mason. Doctor. You say it just to calm me! Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!! Naw, she don't mind. Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it. The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here! The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- ! Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime -- -- alleged crime -- -- in a context. They're going to rob that bank. How do you know? Some things never change. How high up would you say that is? I'd say about thirty feet, sir. You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment. Which bathroom is that, sir? The small one. I want your D.O.R. No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting. Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit. What sector's the air conditioning? Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one. I gotta go in there and shut it down! Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off. Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building? Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here. Oh that's comforting. A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume? He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke. No... Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on! That door is a safely hazard. Not at all. I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property. Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores! Where...where am I? Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine. Reed? ... Sue? They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine. Good evening. I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket? Of course. Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life... Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong! You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me. That's not what I mean... There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John. Gale... I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing. Bodybuilding! We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we? Nobody ever had too much. So now you know. Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought. You really want to know? Yes. It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please. Are you going to kiss me? It's not my back that's killing me. Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good. I forgive you. Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week. Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson  You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz. I got a right. You're my father. I ain't nobody's father! How you doing? I'm drinking. Slowly or quickly? As fast as I can. Come home soon after the show. I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table -- -- did she talk to you? She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose. Did you tell her? I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march -- I love you. Love you too.. Bye. Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock. Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one... You've gone crazy. No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad. Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say. Then don't say it. I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time. To do what? Sort it all out. And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans. A change of plans? Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind. Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit. Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you. Lovely. I'm a slow eater. I love you, man! Well, good night, Louis. Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home? I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me? Oh, sure, that sounds great. Is it possible...? All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible? He's giving them up? All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move. Did the Justice lawyers sign off? That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait. Take the picture out. What's wrong? Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me. I don't... Why would this ship carry instructions in English? Think about it. Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable. Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more. Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it. I feel bad about walkin'. Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses? A few bucks. That's classic. Why... ? Shut up, Ike. And you must be Doc Holliday. Is it dead? Yeah. Don't... talk crazy. Mama...? They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering! Okay Wait till I tell you what it is. It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me. Everybody in? I guess so. Where's Charlie? Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it. ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him! Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you. What are you talking about?  You don't even know me. Does anyone? Well, how did it go?. What happened? Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved. What did you see? Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean? A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this? No. Yeah. Come on. Play it! Come on! You smell that.  You smell that? What? Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that -- You're light a deuce. Am I? You're wearing the thimble. Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you. Hey, you did better than I did, Nova. Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud. Bye, now. Bye, Robert. Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ... There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ... Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless. What can I do for you? Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams. Yeah - I heard - nothing came up. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking. Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me. Touchy, touchy. So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman? Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous. Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I? Look at the size of it! It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand... Let's see it. Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before. You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it. Did you see the size of that thing?! Look what you did! You stupid sonofa- Things have been so serious here lately. Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real. Stop saying the word! Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ... Good day, Mr. Chance. Good day, Sally. It wasn't me. Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me... What s his problem? What? There s something about him that s just a bit odd. Other than, he s shagging your exgirlfriend? No, that s not it. Ed Concannon. Frank Galvin.  We've met before. Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door. Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me. Why?  What's the problem? I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent. I would like to use the bathroom -- You... don't have to... leave. Whatever. Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups? Chloe's dead. When? Do you care? I don't know. It was the smart move on her part. This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game. Very impressive. Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us. Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab. I'll need the sergeant's okay on that. We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told! Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction. Thank you. What's going on here? There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened. I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore! Uh...yeah. It's like hard. Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink? Oh no, nothing for me. Oh, George, George, George. Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real! Oh, George, George! You have no idea what's happened to me. You have no idea what happened . . . It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off? Not particularly. Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right? I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember? You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls... Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be... You're gonna help us take him. No chance. He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated. But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand. There was more than that. Not in the trunk. That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you? Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane. So...what's the good news? Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she? Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash... Casharoonie! Sam, if she's here... I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie. As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul. The United Nations are still here. The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right? Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about. What did you overhear? A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel. What did they say? The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything. Watch everything? How? They are gone. How are you -- is it Joe? Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago. Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff. Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings. No... I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general. It's cool, Jeff. Really. I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody. Toxic dumps, huh. And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge-- You sure about all this? I know him. Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up. Why? Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but-- You don't know me at all. Um-- Kay? What's wrong? Gibarian.  He was here. You said he was dead. He is.  But he was here... Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn t work like that and I can t tell you why. Why not? Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me? Figure it out?  Figure what out?! I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates. Why would they give them to us? The Commander is an old friend of yours. You took this picture? Took 'em all. How about a little of the King? Well, why not a little of the King? Nail it! Yes, sir. What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself. He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery. Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say. Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind. Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit. How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch? You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want? Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger, The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us. We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty. Who? Tommy Reina. True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down. Too bad you're out of it. Who to? None of your business...  Take another letter. Terry!  You okay? Help!  Help! Okay, okay, coming.... Good job, not pretty, but good. Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what? I like your style, Dude. Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'. Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words? Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times. What's the occasion? I quit. Today's my last day. Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies but stay out o' newspaper business! Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late. Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine. Anna's the witch. There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there. He got in here how? Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything. Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet? Yes, Bob. Did you say we saved ninety white people? Yes. Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count. You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob. Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants    and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum. I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing. I'm sorry, I only... Let s go. I don t know what your problem is, but... Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate. Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace. No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son. My  self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got. You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation. We surprised a band of smugglers. Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen. You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you? Oh, for Christ's sake. You are. Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp... ...where is my pill? ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G. WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...? Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex. The structure seems intact.  They have power. California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same? --'cause I only know four chords-- Promise? Promise. Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning. Right. Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well-- Me? Why? Bag-snatcher. But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way. Show me the way? Yes. Jesus, what is this? Another storage room. All in all, quite a canoe... Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish. Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus. Beth you're losing it.  C'mon. C'mon -- what? You're lying -- Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they? But -- And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified. That's when you went in the sphere. One lonely, terrifying sea snake. You manifested that, Beth. Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman. You're insane. Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane? I never went in that sphere. You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that. Yes. You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said. That's bullshit. Is it? Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry. No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it? Shut up, Beth -- When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you? Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it? I'm about to, Mr. President. Who? Satchmo. What's up with you? Bladder infection? Keep it up. How wonderful! That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us. Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't. Oh, George. I don't like him. You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta? These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors. Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan. To your family. To yours. Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins. What does she see in them? Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but... ...we'll gettim in their cars. Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...<u>Jaws</u>.  You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election. Big mistake. Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand... Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour. Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business... Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. Whattaya gonna do when this is all over? What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do? Well, I'll be damned if I <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ...  You know what the worst word is, in the English Language?  It's  retirement."  What the <u>hell</u> was I thinking of?  Hell, I used to... Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember. What, Johnny?  What is it? What it was like when you died in the fire... The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked. I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss. Maybe the antenna's broken. We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box! Phillips head,' right? Yeah. Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing. I don't think she can sing, either. Take care, pal. What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you? Naw. Talking to me, dad? Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off! Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff. I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home. Hector!! Take him. You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble. Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on. What tape? Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound. You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub. I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on. OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day. It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan. Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape? It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen. Pinkertons. It's the railroad. Ma. How long has he been this sick? A few days, ma'am. Why was I not told earlier? Which one is yours - the big one? Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve. I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife? No, my flag steward. And who mixes the cocktails - your wife? No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not - I'm not interested at all. Well, I'm not. That's very interesting. Good. I need everything else. Okay. You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on? No sir, it's unusual. Why am I doing this? It's an experiment. How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch? Sure. Shall we go into the living room? Yes. What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?! Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs. Oh yeah! Don t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won t even be here, will we? And what if you re wrong? I m not. What if you re wrong?? Then I ve been a very bad boy and you ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!! Oh my God...! What happened? I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca! Madam should sleep. I've done my hair differently -- do you like that? When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently. In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette. Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train. Goodnight, Suzette. Hi Tom. Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye. I'll come down. Did you speak to my father? That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal... Okay.  Which one goes? I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you! Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground. Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not? I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic. Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben ? He won't last one round. Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit. I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong. Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!! Happy fuckin' Halloween. Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work. Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight. Where is he? Out in Oklahoma. Are we prepared? Yes, Praetor. See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright. David! Yes, ma'am...? Did I miss something? Are we going into battle? The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died. One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters? You really want to know? No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything. Valentine had himself a party, I hear. My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events. A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client. Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific. Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell? My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager. So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money. He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely. Where is he now? He had urgent business in the north. Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole. You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here? As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy. Yeah, right. Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you. No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it. There's still good in him. I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared. But I had to help my friends. Annie, I think we should have a toast. A toast? Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine. And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning. Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own. Just keep quiet. I have to answer him. So you can give us away? If I don't answer, he'll know something's up. You afraid of these ...? Don't move, Hacene. Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali? It's true. What's happened to you? The NLF has condemned you to death. Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man. Editorials? Kurtz. Yes. The Roumanian? Yes. And? Stay on your heading, Captain. Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it. That's an order. Sorry, Sir. Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up? Well, a ball player. No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame. Ready? Keep them out of my way. Okay.  You ready? Yeah, yeah.  Jesus. Cut. What are you doing that for? It's walkin' pretty slow at this point. You guys are fuckin' sick. You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun. An' you won't let nobody touch me? No--an' look what I got for you. I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars? Nope. I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from... You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart. Naw! They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat. Not down in my parts. Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship? They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor. I thought you guys went to get your hair cut. No. We didn't. I don't know... Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound. Come on, George, no one is going to pay that. It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting. Sixpack? Why can't we pick up his signal? You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky? No. How big is the sub-basement? Apparently it's huge. I think I should come with you. We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight. Is that what I think it is? She lived on the plume.  You never know. Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong. Okay.  Lowell? Yeah? You're sure you want to do this? Why? Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man. You ready...? Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision? Well, you're a little early... I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office? I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there? They sound like finches. They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark. Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth. That would hardly be possible. Since when is faro a business? Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade? I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house. Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads. That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything. Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place? Who? Guess. How should I know? Someone from the past. Who? Give up? YES. Maxine. Not the Maxine? Yup. God, how horrifying. Enjoy the day. You too. Marge? Where are you going? I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra. The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize. Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper! Well--I'll go to Halifax! ...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it. You don't have to-- I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that. You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer. A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no. That's ancient history. It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed? Hardy, what are you doing -- Isn't this how your story goes? Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Not on duty, sorry. Oh, right. You're doing great. I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way. It doesn't matter. Go on. Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second? Hello, Travis. Hello, Betsy. Didja use the commode story? Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too. So. What you mean, so? If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that. Oh, good... ...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said. You can't tell this story. Why not? Some'b'y'll have you killed. Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story... It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best. Yeah, thanks for everything. I don't know. If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again. I don't know. It's been a while. I haven't been sick this year. I know that. Okay. Do you remember me getting sick? Not a specific day. What's this about? Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick? Neither do I. Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about. I do, too. Howdy Pouty. I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself. She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck... You are the prince of the darkness. That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them? Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .  buy and sell? Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange . I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start? That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man. Who? A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault. When was all this? Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself. He amputated his own leg? Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation. Well, they didn't actually mean that. Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here. Well, is it? Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg? 108 and still active? You're startled? Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all. Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him? Very often. And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide. That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course. Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me! I surprise you? Now that's news. I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it? Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course. Then everything is quite all right, isn't it? I think it's interesting. Another kind of game? In a way. This isn't a game. Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives. How can you look at it so clinically? Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement. That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it. What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry? Of course. Do you? Let's change the subject. Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married? Where are we going? To find Rogue. How? The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being. I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends. Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight. Who the fuck are you? Teddy. Your buddy. Prove it. Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy. Yours? You take it. I don't know. Are you nuts? The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket. Keep smokin', fool. We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team -- -- The inside? Night City. It was .... the Emperor .... The Emperor? Yes, he commands you make contact with him .... Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission. Yes, My Lord. And code the signal to my private chamber. Mike... Mike... Mike... Mike? There's still ink on my fingers from last week. You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that? You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago? Yeah.  What? There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored. Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask. So what do I tell this guy? Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his. ... just saying you should think twice about it... ... I don't want to talk about it... I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room. In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are? Where the music's playing and the ladies are... I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you? Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage. Same here. The pleasure is mine. Set what up? That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work. Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write? Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return. Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here. No, I want to go in. Now you stay put! I ain't drunk, honey. Like hell you ain't! She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy. Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle? She loves me the way no woman ever has. The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left. You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks. The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ... Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ... Do you think he can do it? I don't know. He's a very sweet man. Where are you going now? Home. Someone waiting for you? No one's waiting. There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven? If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what? So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm. But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom? I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy. Do you want to talk about doing crazy things. Yes. Never mind. Contact, dude. Then where does a blowjob figure in? Professor Tripp? Hm. How did I get here last night? No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch. And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad? Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia. You fight it cut. And up a dime. Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe. How do you know? You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody? Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it. That's not the country Luke fought for. Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's. It's wrong, Leo. Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden. Is that the question of compassion or science? It's a question. She got the child labor stuff from me. Good God... they're shooting Midge! Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid. I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one. Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy. But -- Get out of my sight. What did you think of 'Great Expectations? Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped. We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit. What about that guy this morning? You mean Shelly? Don't tell me, you're a workaholic. No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman. I suppose he just wants to watch. I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you. There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained. After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive. People have made mistakes in these situations before. I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be. Go on. Rowan.  Go on. Leave me alone! I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't... Excuse me I have to make a call... What are you doing with all these blueprints? Some buildings I'm working on. Are you... an architect? Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card. I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair. You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them. Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir. You choose these? Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons. Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland? No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you? You use words like that, you might make me mad. Yes.  But do you know? Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention. That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating. Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl? I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today. Did Lefferts have a boyfriend? Like I said we were friendly, not friends. How'd she meet Patchett? Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little. Tell me about Patchett. He's waiting for you to mention mention. You want some advice, Miss Bracken? It's Lynn. Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears. Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body. What about the tape? We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now. And if it wasn't? For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore. Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ... Here!  Here!  Pull over! Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife. I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls. Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father? Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family. Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset. Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown. I have heard of them. There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me- Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo... Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants... I met them before you were born. Do you mind if I borrow it? Not at all, if it can help. I can get you a job. A job? Yes, the money is good. As a plumber?! It's easy to learn. A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work! We started over, you can too. You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!? Save that for the Tribune. What did you say your name was -- Pinkus? I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun. Yeah, I read the report... So, what do I say? Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie. Oh my God. I'm so dead... Yeah, you betcha... --a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate! Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*-- You like them, don't you, Boss. Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning. I, I was asked to do this material - - Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes... Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers -- Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny! ...Ed, I... What is it, Dave? <u>Why not, Jerry</u>? Because he believed me. Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good. Jesus, Kevin, rub it in. We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating. No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack! Who can we attack?  They're all too big. Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland! We can't... we keep our money there! There's a test, you know. Forget it, Judy. Elle, I can't. You don't understand. Who could better understand than me? Can I ask you a favour, Major? Yeah. When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect? With more what? More what? Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect. David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew? Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being. A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters. Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise. What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David? Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already... So here we are! Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken. I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide. Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now? My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack? Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it. You might not have a choice. Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness. The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago. Who's Joey Venza? Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in. Hello, L.A. Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour. You bet. How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno? Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together. What'd you do before?  Can I ask? Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around. Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive? Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai. Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks. That's a plan. We'll just be a minute. Can I smoke? She's gone... Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump... All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick? You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey? Hello, John. Colonel. Mind if I sit down? He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind. It's a pity in this... If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline. Why? It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger -- When will I see you again? Goodbye. Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids -- Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends? That's what he told you, huh? No, he showed me one. Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down. Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house. Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense? Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door. May I offer you a drink? Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience. Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here. You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps? Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry? Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup. ... Behind the makeup? Good. But Jeff... I'll call them, Lowell. Jen?  Are you all right? She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair! Don't use my name! Ask the questions. You're both with the mountain rescue team? Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ... Relax, John.  They were just kids. Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect. Well, spit it out. The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance. What the fuck is this? It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all. You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep. How'd you do on the science test? It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C. And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example. What museum? I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtw ngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve. No can do. Let Furtw ngler go. Please. I have a duty. Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture. Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle. What...? She owes me a meal. I'd stay away from her, Miles. I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer? Are you alright? Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened? ...What's so damn strange about that? I didn't say a word. I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball. There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring. Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were? Yeah...you a witch? Not yet.  It takes years of practice... No wonder he let her go. Really. What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were? W...B...2...YXB. Man overboard! Boy overboard! Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there! Fuck. What do you think? He looks like a fuckin' loser. Congratulations. Thanks. So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts? I take it things didn't work out between the two of you? Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you? I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me... What do you mean, you're not sure?! Harry... My God... What happened? Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us - Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice... Jesus... -- Yeah... your car down here? I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi. -- With objection! So noted. What was this for? For bravery. And this? For killing a man. What miracles you do for strangers. I fought for my country.  It was my choice. And now, what do you choose to do? I'm going to finish school. Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you. I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you. Yeah?  And what about my enemies? They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love? I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology... What are they interested in...? Wine, women and song. You should feel right at home with them. She is gone! What happened? Forget about me Kat. But I love you! And how is Mrs. Reiser? Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop. So she's uh, flourishing? She makes felt wallets. Got one right here. The feds. It's evidence. It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money. Miles, when are you going to get married again? I just got divorced. Phyllis. Ahh, not so good, man. One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you. Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing? Far from it. Mm. Hello. Did you get my note? You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie. Huh? You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past? I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone. So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do. What do you read? Twenty eight. How many people do you think heard that thing last night? It plays in 50 states. What?! Nobody else is going to know it was us. You're right.  You better hope so. Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure. Immigration's gonna love you for that. Tell them to send flowers to the usual address. Get anything? She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is. You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you. Well. I'm not going to let that stop me. ...against the computer. They're a finesse team... They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick! Fuck!!! That is so bullshit! We've got nothing to talk about LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you... That s all I wanted to hear... What do we do?  What do you want to do?! I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket. Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please... No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat? Uh, "no"... You're not fat. You sure I'm not fat? <u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...? I didn't -- He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan. I'd have been long gone. Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott. Who are you? I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir. You're my what? Your valet, sir. Anymore ideas...? Yeah -- this time you're gonna help! Keep your mind off her. She's real eat, drink and be merry girl. And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable. Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone. Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness. And some man will lose his. Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction? Well, the salesman could be available soon. He and his wife splitting up? It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case. Isn't he a salesman? Now what could he sell at three in the morning? Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up. He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain. Any ideas yet? Lots of ideas.  No good ones. Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday. Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night. I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away. I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime? I'd be honored. Only that? And charmed, of course. Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted. I had no thought of offending you, Oona. Do I not please you, Jack? In every way. And am I not fair? Wondrously so. Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth? That was in jest. Jest with me then. How so? Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag. You are fair as the first new flower of spring... And sweet? Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind. Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack. I'm sure. Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats. You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back. That's three. And that's one! The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you? I wonder if they're going through this too...? That was about as grim as it gets. The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that. But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on... But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends. You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character. Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him. It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it. Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke! Yippy! Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth. What about Picard? Our greater goal is more important, brother. But, Praetor, you won't survive without him... Must be thousands of them. What are they doing? Looks like they're preparing the invasion. Why?  What happened? Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma. No shit. Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad. Yeah. But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably. Probably. I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair. What have you been up to? Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on-- The torture of small children-- On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights-- Hold those rights. Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man? No! Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while. Well, maybe they migrate? As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack. You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab.... Never stand between that kid and a meatball. Yet another spaghetti night. Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that. Still play with dolls, Doctor? She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one? Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes. Why the hell not? I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood! You've got to be kidding. What... is... happening... ? Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole. Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob. Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know. Well, that's good news. Where am I going? Through there! Right. Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us. What do you call this? A car. Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right. That was my plan. Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common. You going out? Yeah. For a little while. So you're saying it wasn't like that at all. Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you. Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up. Yeah, I picked it up. And started to run. And started to run. Good thinking. That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it. You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to? Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact. So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you. That's it. In a nutshell. Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry. No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now. A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you. That money is my whole future. Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want? Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head. You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit? Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach. Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey? Wait... Well, at least you're accomplished at something... What? At being a fake. We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex... Worf... torpedo... now! You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming? No. They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right? Yeah. Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills. They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them. And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark? No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can. hound of resurrection -- See? I don't like that -- -- Hound of resurrection? Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day. I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months. No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work? Well, at least she's off KANE today No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about? Hedy Lamarr? Jews. She's talking about Jews. Who's that man? He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know. I thought you'd given up that sort of friend. This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him. I don't like him. Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going? No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds. What bonds? The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe. Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago. I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter. Don't you remember.... Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars! Do you realize that you're accusing me of .... No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them? What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours.... That's my business. supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ? That one's for you. Thanks... I'll take it tonight. I can't. After the show. You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one... Shut up. Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered. Shut your mouth and drive! Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ? She coulda killed me last night. Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang. Who are you? Gondorff asked me to look after ya. How do I know you're tellin' the truth. Don't have much choice, do ya? Motherfucker wasn't saying shit. Look at that. Uh, Sue...? I can't. What? What do you mean you -- Sue... look at your hands. Sorry. This is a very special, very old CB 275... Oh. You know who it once belonged to? No. Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar. No kidding. Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him? He was going to-- I know.  He was to take the fucking money. You're tense.  What are you all uptight about? You killed a man for no reason! I'd like to find one of those myself. Oh really? Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory... Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones? Maybe... Need help? I got it.  I got it. You sure?  I can help you. Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me. Nobody's looking. Go in the house. All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto? He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside. Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali? Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur. Wait a second... I can't... couldn't. You say something? Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl. I'm stag. Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me. What? I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks. Are you kidding? No, I'm not kidding. You can't just walk off onna girl like that. I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but... What have they got that we ain't got? Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does. Me, too. You don't seem very angry right now. We can't do this. No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard. ...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to. But in your opinion, would I definitely go? How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie. What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it. The mattress... The mattress... JULIA. You don't go after the local scrunch? I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building. I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets. I never have before. I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God. You didn't think I could just leave you? I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you. What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember? I think you gotta camp it here... What are you talking about? The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch - Pencil it in for the next trip - The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story - Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write - Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations No - The Queen invited you to dinner - Yes - And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting. Excellent. Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!  Come on! Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here. You'll understand. Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'... Wasn't nothin' said about no partner. It's a bug. Right. But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect. Mom...what are you doing here? Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you. You know how to write one of these? There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done. That's all there is to it, huh? That's all. We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...? In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance... Thank you so much. We never met. That's why. Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve. What'd they look like? Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want. Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" -- Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there. Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay? Do I have to? Yes, I'd like you to. You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938. Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk! I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie. Thank you. I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside. I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge. But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you? The thing to do is stick to rabbits. This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so. I'll be fine. She said convincingly. Josie, you have totally transitioned. Transitioned? You crossed over. My pocketbook. What's in it? Beauty products. Is somethin' wrong? With what? With anything? Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything? July of '71. About the past year. The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you. On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one. Who is this . . . Superman? You'll find out, General! And when you do . . . Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod! I found it, Evy! I found it Shut-up and get me off of here! Dr. Gruber ... Yes?  Galvin, right? This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane. Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury. This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete. Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're   What's that about? Forget it. Hey... so, what brings you down here? I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh... What are you trying to say? It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out. How's the stock market? Up, up, up. I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars. Could be.  Do you play the market? No - the ukulele.  And I sing. For your own amusement? Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators. You're society girls? Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark. Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz? Yeah.  Real hot. Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music. So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music. Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career? They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions - - Inauguration balls - - opening of the Opera - - riding to hounds - - and always the same Four Hundred. You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you. You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless - I beg your pardon? You see, I have this theory about men with glasses. What theory? Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight? Tonight? I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play. I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult. Why? I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out. Oh? It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby. You collect shells? Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it. Shell Oil? Please - no names.  Just call me Junior. Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape. How do I do that? 555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through. So... To happy endings. To happy endings. Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints! Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl. Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl. Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me? Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude. What? Don't ask. Ready to roll, partner? Sure thing, and -- Light in those passages ain't so good. I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody. God, I am starving, but I can't eat this... That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too... Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe. Get it, please. Identification? You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there. What happened to him? He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines. Where's the others? Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath. Would someone please come over here and... Fuck! me up the... Ass! You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts? Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you. Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one? Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family. Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us. Fuck you. This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now. You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends? I don't believe it. Why not? You're my friend, Gus. Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off. Got it. Oh my God...we re buried alive... We re alright. Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove. Do I have to pay juice? THANK YOU. Don't mention it. I don't even know your name. Oh look at that. You like it? Oh it's so funny. Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?! Yeah, Roz. Any sign of our friend? Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput? You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter? Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun. Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit? I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me. Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves. But I see them. Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint. Hell, you think I am? I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing. I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that.... Do you know what they fought about that night he went away? I didn't know they had a fight. Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again. A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room. The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc. What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you. Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil. I thought maybe we could talk some more. There's nothing more to talk about. But we work so well together... Fancy a nibble? I couldn't have another bite. Next week we work the park. I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail. You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens... Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger! You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque -- Muncie! Watch your language.... I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror.... They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left. They didn't get my contracts. They--excuse me... Would you care for a drink? Yes. Thank you. He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store. There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood? Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross. Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it? Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please. You were listening outside the parlor window. It's not in the river, is it Harry? Answer me! Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he? Milo? Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. Have a seat. Hello, John. Colonel. Mind if I sit down? Clarence . . . Yes, George? Where's Mary? Oh, well, I can't . . . I don't know how you know these things, but tell me    where is she? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- What in the world would give me that idea? Hildy! Hello, Bruce... No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age. wasn't even thinking about- No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys? I- No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up. You're late. Didn't get much sleep. Well, we've got -- You hated West, Mueller loved him -- Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it -- Bullshit. Look in my pack. Why? Just look. Little pocket. The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo- -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it- -now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so- Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for? Him. Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way. Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy. I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy. How much is it? Two hundred and seventy. It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do. Yeah, all right, listen... So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.... We'd only just met. Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species. Keystone what? Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend. He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can. Why? He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar? No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out. Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you! But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust. But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now. If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right? You know what we're doing with the money. And what about Big Al? Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too. Well... I need to close now -- You live in that house behind the store? Yes I do. You've lived here all your life? Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia? No. What happened? That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend. You came back for the book? Why? My father didn't want it incinerated. I don't know, Ms. Jenzen. Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>? Messenger just dropped it off. No return address. You didn't think to ask? I was in the middle of -- -- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new. It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen. It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all. I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better. I beg your pardon? Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear? Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come -- Let me go, let me go, you creeps... Everybody okay up here? Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way. I understand that this is just another one of your games. Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel. It was a wonderful day. You still haven't answered my question. You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over. The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents-- You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it. A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think. Christ, you don't know what's out there! I know what's in here! Where is it? A friend of yours is here. Did you got through my pants? I might have a solution. You're somewhere else, where? Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this. Uh-huh. And? You're right, you know. We don't have much time. Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you? Why, yes. Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call. All right.  I'll be right back. It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them. I can get ten. Ohhh... Ed? Ohh... do you own a cat? Yeah. Why? Soft and supple. Like a lady's. I try to moisturize regularly. I don't know. I only saw one. I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this. What should I do? Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do. Holy shit. So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment. These *credentials* are against the law! We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here? Pretty, isn't it? It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it? It's me. Hi. Hi. You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that? No, we'll find something around here. Whatta you think? I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner. Or two. Were you really a prize fighter? I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But  I didn't stay in shape  and    I had to take a few dives. A dive? You mean, into the water? Naw, in the ring, a dive is- In the generator room again? Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work. I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey? Easy, boy. Just an idea. Well, thanks, but forget it. You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us. Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in. It's Mark. There's a girl I want to ask you about. You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency? No, I don't. I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off. Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight. It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her. I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call. You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes... Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off. There'll be other chances. Not like this.  Are you even listening? He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you. Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment? I thought you guys were going to call me. Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off. Oh well... branding will do that to you. Everything all right. Huh-huh. You? Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her. I wish I did. Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart? I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool. I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir. He's come to rescue me, father. Well, let's not jump to conclusions ... There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection. Protection? You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now. Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun-- Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that. I'm surprised you aren't blind by now. I'm sorry. Who are you? My wife. What's it like? Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 * That must suck. All... backwards.				 * Definitely! I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day. Had you talked to him much lately? Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure. Did you? Talk about work? Never! I meant did you find other stuff to -- Oh. Yeah. You've been coming in early. It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her. Damn, I thought I had that one. You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan? What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied. Preoccupied with what? Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one! That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it? You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects? And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask. Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you. Have I? It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once! I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet. That's all right -- it's a drip-dry. Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies? Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them. Do you tell lies? They're gonna let some local cop blow him away. Save us all a lot of trouble. Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool. Bullshit! You have no conception of this, do you? You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that? This is really very nice of you. It's no problem, I had a mother once myself. Breathe deeply. <u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>! I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it. Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by. Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it. I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too. Is that the question? You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out. Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it. Me? What'd I do? Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that! I don't know what you're talking about. The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either. No. You've heard of U.S.T.? I just went there for a job. Then how'd I get here? They're not Cong. We're Americans. Look. Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive. Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan? Yes, air? -- OOOMPH. So here is my candidate. What do you think? But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*... Yes sir.. The wings.. How did you know it was "carefully"? Frank told me. No he didn't. For what? Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito. What kind of business? Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors. You're darned tootin'! Ah, dammit! I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you. This doesn't make sense. It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre. I don't like it.  Something's wrong. Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that? We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with. I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>? -- Understood. This is magnificent... Thank you. And this is your "work"? Yes. The vortex is collapsing, sir. Contact Starfleet Command. Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya. You sober? I can talk, can't I? Mike? What? My ass if falling. Your what...? My ass is falling.  It is. What are you talking about? I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore. Get in bed. What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity... You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor. Oh? Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you... You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least! He's a young one. And big for his age. Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me. Actually, it's a lot like that. Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty?? Vada, what's wrong sweetheart? I can't breathe, I'm suffocating. Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look. Huh. When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast. You used the wrong test. Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices. Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out. What? A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him. Why was I not informed of this?  for the rheumatism, you know. What time was it, Mrs. Halligan? It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know. [How much do you want?] [It's non-negotiable.] [Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?] [I told you, non-negotiable.] You had the number. Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later. What are you doing? I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake. Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble? Yes -- when their troubles can harm them. Why won't you ever let anyone help you? What do you want? Don't be so upset. It's OK... What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK? You know he hated my story also. Your story was terrible! The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there? I don't know. Well it looks good.  Let's use it! Is there a picture of her somewhere? No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her? No. Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh? No, you couldn't. I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest. Really? Yeah. You should check downstairs. Why? People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement. You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you? Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better. When you do, let me in on it. I will. I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I? I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect. Do you think we d let him get away with the murder of my brother? We? You and your parents killed your husband? No. Not us... What did they say before the bad card came up? You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money. You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything. Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then- What's wrong with it? You look like you just crawled out of bed. No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on. Yes. And where did you sit that morning? My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat. And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning? Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was. Any gas? Gallon or two? Well, looks like we done it this time awright! Darling!?! I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor. I forgot about that. Can I come home with you when we get there? Yeah. It's ok to ask that. I thought that you were anyway. What does it mean? The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near . Erik! You've done what you came to do! Not quite... We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating. I hope so. That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie -- Jean, your parents are here. Hi Dad. Hi Nora. We're locked in. Are you insane?  He'll kill us both! Maybe it's better that way. Lunch... God... Get out. Both of you. Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all. Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent. Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet. When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die? Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die. I can't find my ball. Can you see it? What do you mean by that? Just what you think I mean. Are you threatening me? Sort of... Yeah. You wrote that you had trouble sleeping. Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you. Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean? Yes, I believe I do. Ricky?  Where...what... I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome. Thank ...you. Anytime. Why... yes. Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing? I suppose.  It's very expensive. It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas. What are you, an angora wholesaler? No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer. Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that. Two people do.  Orson Welles and me. Wow. You know, you're a very attractive girl. I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking. How'd you meet Early? Is this supposed to be an apology? It s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings-- So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs. Hey, look! Hey... Thought you wanted something fun... I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over. Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want. I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation? God. Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never... Congratulations on the math contest, Richard. It really wasn't that difficult. So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow. And...? And, take some more pictures. Wow, you are smart. And you are great in bed. If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here. Evening News? We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times. Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail! Are you crazy? Don't worry! You're out early. Yeah. Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately. I been working on a few things. Uh-huh. I'm going over to the other side. The Republicans? No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody. They got telephones. Gotta be in person. Oh. So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women? They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones? Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along? Here you are. Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother-- None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving. Was the paralysis immediate? No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back -- How long after that was the paralysis complete? Nearly a year. Any attacks of pain since? Yes, Doctor. Is her pain sporadic or constant? It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent. See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it? I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny. I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding. Hey stud:  I thought we had something together. We do. All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool. I also gotta win. They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange - Please don't talk any more, Charles. But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better. Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell. How long's this been going on? Since the murder. She was fine before that. Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell. It's just made her think... her dreams are real... That's not the point. You said whatever it was you would understand. That was before I found out what it was. Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair? Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years. Well, it certainly says you. You really think so? Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice. What about the schools? Yeah. What about the kids' school? Sign here please. What is it? It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was? Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line? No, no ... we wouldn't do it. Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex. Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now. Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great! Well, Annie, your place or mine? You got me all confused. A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing-- I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman. Got a match? Very funny. Very funny. Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual -- Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can -- I'm going in. Here goes nothing. You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street. Why are you always afraid to get somewhere? This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal. This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street. Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him? Maybe I can get down there next week. Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile... Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth? There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man. I liked him better before he died. It's what they want you to see. This is the way in? Yes... Are you sure you want to do this? Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again. Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove. Do I have to pay juice? Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas! No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice. Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it. Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you. The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington. Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent. That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living. So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick -- Not yet. Nope. It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall. Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me. I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier. The best friend I ever had. May I say something, Mr. President? There's no secrets here, Al. You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you. Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it? Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas. Why'd you ask him. He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions. Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here. We have a problem here? Jack Foley, famous bank robber. I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services. This chink have a name? Bubba. Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip? Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be -- It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary. Phantom Mary? Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary? No. Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story? Yeah! Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange... It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now. Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me. Reed's gonna fix me up -- For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical. Skeptical...? On screen... We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative... Can I go get those mangos now? I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile -- You know this guy, don't you? I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out. By stealing my car? I would've come back for you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit? I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out. Not these guys. Yeah, those guys too. Where are you going? To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him. Haps, railroad, bus timetables? Everything. You forgot this. Thanks. I've been hoping to run into you. What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back? I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories. Why, you sweet kid. There's one called....Window... something with a window. Dark Windows.  How did you like it? I didn't. Thank you. Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ... The Ark of the Covenant. Are you sure? Pretty sure. I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father. He's an Italian? A pig of a Neaponitan. This is private property.  This is breaking and entering! Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute. This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score. Heh heh. Thank God. We got to get movin'. What for? Because there's a man I want to see. He can wait. Let's stay here until morning. Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack. Fun -- look at that guy... It's just the dope, don't worry Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me! Not me. The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you. He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around. He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners. What? Our own special bus. How do you know it's for us? Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool! What's she talking about? The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen. Fellas. Hey, Sam. Open late. ... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology. I agree. ... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner? Yes. I am very hungry. ... So am I, my boy - so am I. You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes! Look who's talking! Leave him alone! Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up. Are you a private detective? Something like that. How much do you make? Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl. Three hundred? This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall. I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl. Up front? Half now, half later. Make it nine hundred. That was my best week. Okay. My client pays for it anyway. When do we start? Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective? This is different. This is nine hundred dollars. Superman. . .  But you're... dead! Still having delusions, Lex Luthor? Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel. Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter? I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans? Tonight? Any night. Well, not exactly... Would you be willing to have dinner with me? Yes? Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again. Ummm...what? I didn't hear you. I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something. Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way! You got it, G.G. Goodnight. Goodnight. I like trees. So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there. Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole? Yeah. How did Kittridge do it?.. Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact. How many are there? 24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile. That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they? Ryan's really angry with me. I think he's really angry with me too. It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank. I'm sorry. Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment. That's a lot of those. Medallions. A lot of cakes. Yes. And he doesn't smoke? He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better. How long have you been married? Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about. You must have been a baby. Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold. Come here. It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that. You killed them. Are we gonna keep going with this game? Yes. You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this -- Alright. hang in there, ok. I love you. You're not going to play it again. Well, lemme play the other side then. No. It doesn't go like that. Who asked you? If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE. George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones... Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall. I get it now. You and me. We're dead. Dead? Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven. Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate. And some really fast cars. The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different. There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar. The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go! Mommy -- Yes, darling. Did you ever make a wish? Oh, lots of times. Did your wishes ever come true? Sometimes. I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would. Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it? Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately. It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think? Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one. What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here? Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council? Yeah, that'll do for openers! H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr... Works for me. I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this. I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight-- Don't do this Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years-- Don't do this --Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -! The what? The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet? Show Mr. Van Orton to his room. The key? Hm? Is there a room key? Didn't I give you two? No, you didn't... Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me. Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check. Jesus--what's got into Nuke? I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril. I'm getting too old for this game. Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought-- I know. No, that's alright. Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid. Well, what's going on? I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear. You were a roadie for Motley Crue? Yup. Huh huh. We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role. Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing. I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone! Why didn't you give a warning signal? Your foreman says that's a foreman's job. Sure, Charlie. Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime   when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic. How much? Oh, about five hundred. Do you really think you can beat him? Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson? I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things. Hey, Sonny - You did it! Let's move it, goddamn it. You know where he went? What's he done? He stole something. From a friend of mine. He must be a good friend. We're very close. What'd he steal? A chip. Goes in a computer. One chip? The most important one. Can you help me find him? How do you know you can trust me? Got to trust someone. The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain. Our... 'insignificance'? You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right? Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords? Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right? Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl! Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote? I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...! Shove it up your ass you faggot! ...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell! Fuck him!!! ...Be gone!! Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!! ...from this creature of God!!! What do you see? I don't know. Hey. They got a shitload of cookies. Take 'em. How 'bout the tree? You want the tree? Leave the tree. What's wrong? What do you make of this? No touch. No touch. No touch. You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me. Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black. Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party! Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender? Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh? What about him? You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name? Something's screwy here. So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug. Thanks, but no thanks. Against your code? I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come? Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder? No. Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them? That's right. Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling. Why were Lefferts' eyes black? I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan. You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? Wait.  Our deal still holds? So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know. I know. So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'... Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon? First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand. I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win. Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges. You learn that in your psychotherapy group? Discussion group, Alex, discussion. You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies. And if you do it wrong? It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh... What's that, Lilly? Boy. It sure has been a long time. We were here two Christmases ago. Well, that's a long time. It's not that long. Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny. SO! You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch! Oh Jesus. I simply can not stand that tone! Yeah, I'll go. Ok. Let's see what happens. ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN. ..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash.... Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins? It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it? Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again! You see what you're doing, don't you? What am I doing? You're charming the boy. Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question. Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury. That's my cousin, Angelo. How the hell did we get this detail? Guess it's our turn. Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn. Oh yeah. What does this mean? It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out. He's just ... trying a little too hard -- I was trying to tell you... it's a game. A game? It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself. What are you talking about? The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away... You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ? I'm sorry, about this... You should be. One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car. There's no scar. Corvis made it up. What? Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse. Shut up! Oh, yes!  Yes! Oh, baby! Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman! OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!! YOU BASTARD!! How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant? Thirty-eight...simulated. And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan. Scamming's a strong word. Weir is dead. Then who the fuck are you? Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller? This car needs petrol. Shut up and drive! But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there! It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC. Their fourth! It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money. Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson? I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes. Maybe pants. Go, go, go, jump! You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump! Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now! No... How? The Telegraph office. But we were so careful. We pushed it. We got lazy. Less the place really is haunted. Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents. And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>. Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe. Two weeks and three days. Um-hum! Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron? No, not at all! Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report. I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles. And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption. I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown. And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report. Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report? I am only insinuating that you are nervous. Nervous! Why should I be nervous? I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron! Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind. No, no. So will you? Of course. Yes. I will.     I do. I should have known something like this was going to happen! Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy! ... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up... We ain't buying that. Paul. Are you alright? We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel. We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed. Tell her to go back to Resurrection. She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in. They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids. We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch. Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo. Duck! Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man! Where's your gun? Chest pocket.  Shit! This is a six-shooter. Something just must've...frightened her, that's all. Yeah...something. ... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are. The American people put me where I am. I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway? Siam. Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam... Stop him, Clark! He may have a gun! Oh, for God's sake! Where's the Nuevo American Diner? Ten miles back on the Texas side. I'll come with you. Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own. How's the new residence? O.K. What does that mean? Not too good in daylight .. C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John. Can I help you? Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian. Perhaps, I could assist in finding them? Well... that might be... helpful. Hello... hello. How are you this morning? Do they talk?! No, they don't talk... We talk to them. I understand. Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss. Are you Teddy? My name's Leonard.							 * Did Teddy send you? I don't know. Do you see any family resemblance here? You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous. I put him to work. What's wrong? Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read. Yeah, I know. It might be too late already. What are you waiting for? I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary. I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him. Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir? Nice. Hm?  Oh, yes. How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways? I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them? Altar boys? Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody? Will you get a hold on yourself. Don't touch me!  Don't touch me! What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you? I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical. Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude. I'm having a stroke. You've come far. You're a good man. I love you. Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy. We have never been friends. Where are we going? To take a picture. Stand still, Miss Jenny! There! What's so hard about that! I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go. I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley. You're not Baxter? My name is Emmett. And you're not Baxter, either? Did, uh... Did you kill him? I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way. I'd have liked to have said goodbye. He knows. You sound so sure. I am about this. ... oh... God...
